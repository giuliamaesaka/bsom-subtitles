00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:08,220
Hello and welcome back to measure theory. This 
is part 3 and today we will finally start talking  

2
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:14,340
about what measure is. I will start talking 
about the definition and then I explain you  

3
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:21,870
all the details. Afterwards then I can show you 
some examples for measures. To summarize in this  

4
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:28,590
video the question would be: what is a measure? 
To answer this question let's immediately start  

5
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:36,750
with the definition. What we need is a set X and 
a sigma-algebra on the set X and let's call this  

6
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:44,220
Sigma Algebra just A. And such a pair is then just 
called a measurable space. So nothing special,  

7
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:51,750
it just means you have a set X and you fixed one 
Sigma algebra on this set. And by now you know  

8
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:59,910
that a sigma algebra is a special collection of 
subsets of this set X. Now we will look at special  

9
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:09,060
maps that are defined on the Sigma algebra A. And 
such map I will always call by our lowercase mu.  

10
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:17,580
So it's defined on the Sigma A and maps into 
the positive real numbers. However we include  

11
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:26,040
some small detail: on the one side we include 0, 
so 0 is allowed, and then we go to infinity, so  

12
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:33,060
this would be our normal interval: so we just look 
at a positive real line including 0. But here in  

13
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:39,630
the measure theory, we will change this a little 
bit we also include infinity. OK, this might look  

14
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:46,710
a little bit strange, and it is, because we just 
include one new symbol, so this means, we have our  

15
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:54,210
positive real line where we include the 0, so this 
is normal, but we also include a new symbol and we  

16
00:01:54,210 --> 00:02:01,230
just call this symbol infinity. And to shorten 
this notation, we just write here also infinity  

17
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:08,580
is included in the interval. This means that it is 
just a short notation for saying that we have also  

18
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:16,450
a symbol infinity involved. How to calculate with 
this new symbol, I tell you later. First I want to  

19
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:23,680
tell you how such a map is now called. Maybe not 
so surprising such a map is now called a measure.  

20
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:31,750
However only if the following two conditions are 
fulfilled. To see what these two rules should be,  

21
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:40,570
maybe recall what we want. We want to measure 
subsets of this set X, which means we want to  

22
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:48,820
give a volume to such a subset. So a generalized 
length or generalized volume. Therefore makes  

23
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:54,670
totally sense to restrict ourselves to the 
positive real numbers where we also include zero  

24
00:02:54,670 --> 00:03:01,660
and the symbol infinity; which means we could also 
have a volume of zero and maybe also an infinite  

25
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:09,460
volume. But all other volumes should be positive 
numbers. From this, we immediately get our first  

26
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:17,440
property because we know that the empty set is a 
subset of X and in all Sigma algebras A involved.  

27
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:24,340
Therefore we want to measure this empty set or we 
want to give it a volume. But the only sensible  

28
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:33,190
volume we can give the empty set would be zero. 
If there are no elements involved, the generalized  

29
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:39,760
volume should be zero. Okay for the start not so 
complicated so let's go to our second property,  

30
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:48,520
this property should fix the idea that we can 
add up volumes. Or in other words, if we have  

31
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:58,750
a subset given (so maybe just in this rectangle), 
then we could split it up into subsets (so maybe  

32
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:10,060
in this way maybe here line and here line). So I 
would call this A1, this is A2, this A3, A4, and  

33
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:19,600
A5. Now if we add up all these separate volumes, 
we should end at our original volume. And this  

34
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:26,470
is the condition I can write down. So adding up 
all the volumes where we start with i equals to 1  

35
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:33,910
and we'll end with five, or we just write an N in 
this generality. So we're adding up the volumes,  

36
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:43,000
which means I add up mu of A_i. And we also 
know, we chose the sets to be disjoint, pairwise  

37
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:50,890
disjoint, because we want a decomposition of our 
original set. Pairwise disjoint means now that  

38
00:04:50,890 --> 00:05:00,760
A_i intersected with A_j is the empty set if the 
indices do not coincide. So i is not equal to j.  

39
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:07,660
Now you see something's missing in our condition 
but we can fix that immediately because we know  

40
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:16,630
this should be the original volume. So I can write 
this as the volume of the union of all these sets.  

41
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:26,950
So I write here i equals to one going to N and 
here I have my A_i. This is the union that gives  

42
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:34,480
us indeed our original green set here. And this 
condition should be satisfied no matter which  

43
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:43,600
sets we chose. So I just write this should hold 
for all A_i out of our Sigma algebra. And this  

44
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:51,100
property is what one calls just additive. It tells 
you that if you have a finite union, you can split  

45
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:59,200
that up into a finite sum of the volumes. However 
I should tell you, this is not the full story. We  

46
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:06,190
also want to include the intuition that we can 
also approximate volumes. Maybe I explain it  

47
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:11,830
again in the picture. So if you want to calculate 
the volume of this rectangle, we can split it up  

48
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:23,080
again into subsets so this is my set A_1. Then I 
also choose an A_2 here and A_3 here and then I go  

49
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:32,350
on and on. So this would be my A_4 and A_5 and 
you see I get smaller and smaller. But you see  

50
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:41,320
I get again the decomposition of my original set 
into disjoint subsets. However, I have infinitely  

51
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:49,150
many subsets now. But they are countable, which 
means I have a sequence of subsets. Now you know,  

52
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:57,970
I can still form the union of all the subsets to 
get out my original set. Which means I put in here  

53
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:06,910
an infinity symbol to denote this union. And if 
I add up the infinitely many unions, I should  

54
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:14,560
also get out the original volume. So instead of 
a finite sum, I have now a series here; but it's  

55
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:22,180
the series of non-negative numbers. Therefore to 
denote this countable infinite additive rule, we  

56
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:30,070
usually call it sigma additive. And please recall 
we had the same idea in the definition of the  

57
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:37,180
Sigma algebra: we want this union, this countable 
infinity union, also be in the Sigma algebra. And  

58
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:43,240
therefore this is also well-defined because if we 
choose elements from the Sigma algebra, we know  

59
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:49,360
that this countable union is also in a sigma 
algebra. Therefore we can calculate mu of this  

60
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:56,620
one. And now we have it this is the definition 
of a measure. Maybe let's summarize that:  

61
00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:04,030
a measure has to live on a Sigma algebra. It does 
not have to be the whole power set (it could be),  

62
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:09,940
but in general we will see we can't do it for 
the whole power set. This just means that we  

63
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:17,230
want to measure some meaningful subsets from our 
set X. Measuring subsets now means giving them  

64
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:23,890
a generalized volume, so it makes sense to give 
them a volume in the non-negative numbers where  

65
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:30,700
we also include a symbol infinity. And then the 
two properties generalize the ideas from a volume  

66
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:38,080
measure. The first thing tells you nothing should 
have a zero volume and the second tells you that  

67
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:45,820
you can calculate the volume by splitting it up 
into countable many subsets. Now let's assume you  

68
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:53,430
have a measure chosen, then we can also fix that 
in our informations here. You would write X with  

69
00:08:53,430 --> 00:09:00,690
the Sigma algebra A and with our measure on the 
Sigma algebra A: mu. And this is what we call a  

70
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:07,920
measure space. This is of course a very important 
notion because the measure space is the space we  

71
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:15,150
work in. Very good. Now you learned what such 
a general measure space is. And now we can talk  

72
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:24,570
about some simple examples. Let us fix for all 
the examples, an arbitrary set X and also a Sigma  

73
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:30,120
algebra on the set X. And maybe we start with the 
best case scenario that we can choose the whole  

74
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:38,760
power set for the Sigma algebra. The first measure 
is very important and very easy, it's called the  

75
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:45,450
counting measure. No matter what set X is, you 
can always define this counting measure. Simply  

76
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:53,130
by setting that the measure of an arbitrary subset 
a is defined in the following way and I consider  

77
00:09:53,130 --> 00:10:01,050
two cases here. The first case would be that A 
has only finitely many elements. In this case,  

78
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:07,410
I want the measure to be this number, so I can 
just write down the number of elements just by the  

79
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:14,250
number symbol. So this is a well-defined natural 
number or zero. So we don't have a problem,  

80
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:21,510
defining exactly this. Okay for the other case, 
I set it to infinity. Which means if A has not  

81
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:28,830
finitely many elements, I say it has infinitely 
many elements. There you see: it makes sense to  

82
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:35,520
use our symbol infinity. What you can now show is 
that this defines really a measure, so it fulfills  

83
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:41,490
these two rules. So that the empty set gets sent 
to zero is immediately clear because the empty  

84
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:48,480
set has finitely many elements and the number of 
elements is zero. So no problem there and also  

85
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:55,470
the Sigma additivity, you can easily show if you 
just deal with finite sets. If you deal with the  

86
00:10:55,470 --> 00:11:01,140
infinite sets, it's also easy to show but then you 
need to know what are the calculations rules when  

87
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:08,890
I deal with this infinity symbol. And this is 
what I now want to show you. So just the basic  

88
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:14,980
calculation rules. The idea is of course thinking 
in the volumes. So if you have one volume x,  

89
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:22,810
and then you add up an infinite volume (so you add 
up infinity), you also should get out to infinity  

90
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:30,640
again. And this should hold for all x in our set. 
So also for the symbol infinity. Or other words  

91
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:36,910
infinity plus infinity is always infinity. In the 
same way we can do this for the multiplication:  

92
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:46,270
so x times infinity should be also defined as 
infinity. However now be careful, I want to  

93
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:54,130
exclude 0 now. So if I multiply a positive number 
with infinity, we get out to infinity again, but  

94
00:11:54,130 --> 00:12:01,840
not for 0. For the special case 0 times infinity, 
there are different conventions. In general, you  

95
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:08,140
would just say this is undefined because it could 
mean anything. However in most cases in measure  

96
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:14,380
theory, it's also nice to have a definition 
for this combination of the symbols, and we  

97
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:22,000
set it to 0. However keep in mind, this is not 
always applicable and, outside of measure theory,  

98
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:29,620
it could be completely wrong. Often this occurs 
if we want to multiply two volumes. Then let's  

99
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:37,030
go to the next example and this one is called the 
Dirac measure. Maybe for this one visualize your  

100
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:47,560
set X here where we choose one fixed point, so we 
choose here maybe a point p inside X. And now we  

101
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:54,010
just want that the whole measure is concentrated 
in only this point. The usual notation one chooses  

102
00:12:54,010 --> 00:13:01,540
for this measure is a delta where we have an index 
p to denote the point. Now for a given subset A,  

103
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:11,770
we also define it with two cases. It is either 1 
or 0. The idea we could also sketch in our drawing  

104
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:19,810
here. So if this is our set A, we see that p is 
inside the set A. And if we want to volume to be  

105
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:26,680
concentrate at the point p, we now would say: okay 
this set has measure 1. So it doesn't matter how  

106
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:34,630
small the set is. As long as the special point 
p is inside, it has measure 1. But if P is not  

107
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:41,320
inside the set, then it has measure 0. A good 
visualization would be to think of this point as  

108
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:48,190
a point charge. The whole charge is in the point 
but if you look at the surrounding you would give  

109
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:55,900
also the surrounding exactly this charge. Okay so 
these were two measures that work on every set X,  

110
00:13:55,900 --> 00:14:05,050
so in particular also for our special case R^n. 
Or in other words these measures don't measure  

111
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:13,660
the normal volume you, for example, have in R^3. 
They are indeed generalized measures. But we know  

112
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:20,770
we also want to have this normal volume measure in 
R^n. Therefore the exercise for measure theory is  

113
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:30,280
in particular to find a measure on X equal to R^n 
that has some nice properties. The first property  

114
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:37,570
would fix that it measures the normal volume. 
This means that if I put in the unit cube in  

115
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:45,040
the measure, which is a cube that has length 1 in 
all directions, then I want to get out the volume  

116
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:52,660
1 as well. And the second property means it does 
not matter where we measure the volume in space.  

117
00:14:52,660 --> 00:15:01,510
In other words, the measure is invariant under 
translations. So I can write that as x plus our  

118
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:10,780
set A is equal to the volume of the set A. And 
this holds for all translation vectors x in R^n.  

119
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:19,690
Also visualize always this property in a short 
picture. If you have your volume here so maybe  

120
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:27,460
this might be the set A. And now I translate all 
the points with a fixed vector x. Then I find the  

121
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:36,600
new set x plus A here. So this is my set x plus A. 
And of course this should have the same volume in  

122
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:43,890
our surrounding space. Of course this is not true 
for an abstract generalized measure from before.  

123
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:49,800
But it should be true for our measure that we 
want to find that generalizes the normal volume  

124
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:57,990
measure in R^n. However keep in mind: we only know 
how to measure such cubes or cuboids and not how  

125
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:04,230
to measure such an arbitrary subset. And that's 
the idea that we want to extend this notion and  

126
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:11,670
still conserve these two properties. Later we will 
see that we can indeed define a measure with this  

127
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:17,550
two properties and that is what we then call the 
Lebesgue measure. And in the next video you will  

128
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:25,020
see that we can't choose the whole power set as 
a sigma-algebra. We have to choose a smaller one  

129
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:32,070
such that we can conserve these two properties. 
And there you will see that we can easily work in  

130
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:38,940
the Borel sigma-algebra. Well very good. That's 
all I wanted to tell you today and I hope that  

131
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:45,750
helped you a little bit. For the next videos, 
the real measure theory can start because now we  

132
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:53,220
have the notion what a measure and a measure space 
is. So thank you very much and see you next time!

00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:06,390
Welcome to measure theory! This is part 1 of a 
series where I want to give you an introduction  

2
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:13,890
into measures and integrals  and where we will 
prove some interesting results, in the end, which  

3
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:20,520
are used very often in mathematical topics.
The motivation is indeed the famous Lebesgue  

4
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:28,140
integral. And to define the Lebesgue integral, we 
need a meaningful notion of a measure. So let's  

5
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:36,720
start here with the real line. Now we can look at 
subsets on the real line and ask how to measure  

6
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:45,990
this subset. Or in other words what is the measure 
of this subset? And this is what Measure Theory is  

7
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:52,860
about: we want to give the subsets a meaningful 
measure or, in other words, a generalized volume.

8
00:00:52,860 --> 00:01:00,360
Or, in this case of the real line, a generalized 
length. The notion of length is what you know  

9
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:07,290
from the real line if you look at intervals.
If you have an interval in the real line from a to b,

10
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:15,750
(you would write it as a to b, and the whole subset 
is this), then you would say this has a length of  

11
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:23,670
b minus a. The natural question is now: what do we do 
if the subset looks more complicated than such an  

12
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:29,940
easy interval? How can we then calculate the length?
There immediately, the Measure Theory comes in.

13
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:36,960
And maybe we also want to deal with different 
notion of lengths. So we want to generalize this  

14
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:43,440
natural length. So maybe depending on the problem,
we want to choose different lengths or different  

15
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:49,500
definitions of the length, so giving some weights 
at different parts to make our problem easier.

16
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:55,680
Here you immediately see, the real line 
gives us a lot of motivation why you want to  

17
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:01,470
measure subsets of the real line. But obviously, we 
don't want to stop there, we also want to measure  

18
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:09,360
areas, so in R^2, or even higher dimensional volumes,
for example, normal volumes in three dimensions, and  

19
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:17,560
so on. So therefore it makes sense to immediately 
start an abstract measure theory, which now means we  

20
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:26,860
just look at an abstract set, and we call it just 
X. So X is just set. And for the set, we want to  

21
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:34,090
measure the volume, the generalized volume, of the 
subsets. So we will define a map which we will  

22
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:40,270
call later just a "measure". Of course, this map 
should fulfill some rules but I will talk about  

23
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:48,220
this later. First let us start on the set level.
Because we want to measure the subsets of X, it's  

24
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:56,200
good to start with the power set of X.
The power set is just the set of all subsets of X.

25
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:03,460
And to give you a short reminder, let's do an example.
If we have the set with two elements (so let's call  

26
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:12,220
the elements just lowercase a and b), then we can 
write down the power set. The empty set is always  

27
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:19,180
a subset of the set so, we always have the empty 
set in the power set. And the set itself is also  

28
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:27,310
a trivial subset. So X is in the power set. Now we 
have only two elements in the set. So we can't form so  

29
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:35,320
many subsets, so the only possible way would be:
okay choose one element, so a, and form a subset,

30
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:43,180
and choose the other one. And in fact, these are 
all the subsets, so we now have defined the whole  

31
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:50,920
power set. So this is what you have to know.
You have to know how to form subsets of a given set.

32
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:59,740
And now we can give the definition for measurable 
sets. When I say "measurable set", you may recognize  

33
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:07,930
immediately the idea that, maybe, we don't have to 
measure all the subsets we can form but only some. 

34
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:15,040
If we have quite an amount of subsets we can and 
want to measure, maybe that's good enough for our  

35
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:22,660
theory. And therefore we call such sets "measurable".
We will later see that we indeed have to do that  

36
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:31,030
because if we want to generalize even this easy 
measure, given by the length, to all the subsets,

37
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:39,700
it's not possible. Yeah, it's only possible if we 
choose good sets as subsets. For these sets,

38
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:49,480
we can generalize this length in a meaningful way.
In the sense, we now look at a subset of the power  

39
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:56,980
set. So we look at a family of subsets that could 
be the whole power set (so there could be equality here)

40
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:06,040
but, in general, we would have a smaller 
family of such subsets of X. So keep in mind  

41
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:14,710
this fancy A has as elements subsets of X. And 
such a collection is called a "Sigma algebra"  

42
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:22,840
if it fulfills the following rules. And these
will be three rules. Please keep in mind that  

43
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:28,540
this notion of a Sigma algebra is indeed the 
important definition in the whole measure theory.

44
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:35,830
and therefore we start with this here. 
The elements in the Sigma algebra will be called the "measurable sets".

45
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:43,060
So these are the sets we can measure in the 
end. Therefore, we immediately have the first rule  

46
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:50,620
here because we want to measure the easiest sets,
which will be the empty set (also here in the  

47
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:58,450
power set given) and the whole set itself. So we 
want these two sets as elements in our Sigma algebra  

48
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:06,220
because we want these sets to be measurable. 
In the same sense, we get out the next rule:  

49
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:14,470
So what happens if we know we can measure a set A? 
So A in this curly A. Then we want to be able  

50
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:25,090
to also measure the complement of the set.
And I denote the complement by A^c, so A^c means X without  A itself.

51
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:33,580
So this should also be a measurable set,
so in the Sigma algebra A. To visualize this maybe  

52
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:46,040
a short sketch. So we have here an arbitrary set X 
and inside also some subset A. Measurable now means  

53
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:54,650
we know we can give a sensible generalized volume 
to the set A. If we know this generalized volume, we  

54
00:06:54,650 --> 00:07:02,540
should also know the generalized volume outside.
But this means, the complement so A^c should also  

55
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:11,810
be a measurable set. Therefore this rule (b) totally 
makes sense. This is what we naturally need.

56
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:17,900
In the same sense, the third tool comes in.
One could say that this third rule comes in from a  

57
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:26,570
measure process point of view. And it also gives the "Sigma" in the Sigma algebra a meaning. However, maybe,

58
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:34,040
I first tell you what the rule says and then we can 
discuss where it comes from. So we start here with  

59
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:40,760
countably many subsets, which means we have A_i
where the index i goes through all natural numbers.

60
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:47,180
We could repeat the same set here, so 
then we only have finitely many subsets chosen,

61
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:54,500
but the important thing is, if we have infinitely 
many, they are countable. Then we can look at the

62
00:07:54,500 --> 00:08:01,550
union of all the sets. So I can write the union 
symbol going from 1 to infinity. This defines us  

63
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:09,800
again a subset of X. And the claim is now: this 
is also in our Sigma algebra. This means that we  

64
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:17,300
can't leave the Sigma algebra by using the normal 
union, so union of two sets and even not if we use 

65
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:26,360
a countable union of infinitely many sets. Maybe 
we visualize that again in a short picture. This

66
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:38,120
is again our set X and we have a subset A inside.
Now assume we have measurable sets inside (so given  

67
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:48,950
as these squares or rectangles, so this would be A_1 and then we have here A_2 and so on). The idea  

68
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:58,650
would be now that we can form the set A out of 
a countable union of the smaller sets A_i. If the  

69
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:05,400
blue sets are measurable, which means they have 
generalized volume, then the generalized volume  

70
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:12,960
of A should be the limit of the sum of all these 
generalized volumes. Or speaking of areas: if you  

71
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:20,850
add up all the areas inside we can form, then you 
should get out the area of A. And in order to speak  

72
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:29,160
of an area or a generalized volume of A, we need that the 
set A is measurable. So it should be an element in  

73
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:35,160
a Sigma algebra. So this countable union should 
also be an element in a Sigma algebra. And these  

74
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:42,630
are all the rules. All systems of subsets with 
these three rules now are called Sigma algebras.  

75
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:50,400
To close the definition I now write down 
what I told you the whole time: An element in  

76
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:57,870
the Sigma algebra is called a measurable set.
So "Sigma algebra" and "measurable" are important  

77
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:04,380
notions in this Measure Theory, here. "Measurable" 
is given with respect to a given Sigma algebra,

78
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:13,290
therefore sometimes also A is in the definition 
of "measurable" so it's called "A-measurable" if we  

79
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:22,650
should emphasize which Sigma algebra is used here.
So now, of course, we need some examples.

80
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:30,300
We know that a Sigma algebra needs at least two 
elements, namely the empty set and set X itself.

81
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:37,410
And this is always smallest possible Sigma 
algebra. So A defined with these two elements  

82
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:45,510
is a Sigma algebra because (b) and (c) in the rules 
are trivially fulfilled. The complements are in  

83
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:53,430
and also all possible unions you can form with 
these two elements are also in. Hence, this is the  

84
00:10:53,430 --> 00:11:00,210
smallest possible Sigma algebra. The question is 
now what is the largest one but this is also easy  

85
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:08,490
to see because the power set itself fulfills, also trivially,
all these rules. Because by definition,

86
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:14,190
all possible subsets are immediately in the 
powerset. So you can't leave it with the complements,  

87
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:20,430
and also not with the unions. No matter if they 
countable and uncountable. Therefore this would  

88
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:27,900
be the best case scenario that we can measure all 
possible subsets. However I already told you for  

89
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:34,530
important examples we can't fulfill this. And 
therefore our sigma-algebra will lie between  

90
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:42,150
these two extrema. Of course, it would be nice 
to have a lot of measurable sets therefore the  

91
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:49,110
rule would be to get as close as possible to the 
second case, to the power set. But this is what we  

92
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:55,290
will do in later videos here in this series. So 
maybe that's good enough for the introduction here.  

93
00:11:55,290 --> 00:12:01,530
Now you know what a sigma algebra is.
And next time we will talk more about measures and  

94
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:08,130
define what a measure is. Therefore thank you 
very much for listening and see you next time.

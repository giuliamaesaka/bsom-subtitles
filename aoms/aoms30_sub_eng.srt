Hello and welcome back to the next mathematical symbol.

2
00:00:03,786 --> 00:00:06,516
Which is given by these pointy brackets.

3
00:00:07,086 --> 00:00:12,637
Often there is a comma in between, but sometimes you also see a straight line

4
00:00:12,837 --> 00:00:16,896
and this is in mathematics how we denote an inner product.

5
00:00:17,371 --> 00:00:22,077
This means it's a special multiplication we find in a vector space.

6
00:00:22,586 --> 00:00:28,898
So you see one vector you would put here on the left-hand side and another one here on the right-hand side.

7
00:00:29,343 --> 00:00:36,652
Hence if we call the vector space V, we can see it as a map defined on the Cartesian product, V with itself

8
00:00:37,043 --> 00:00:42,388
and then the outcome of this inner product calculation should be a real or complex number.

9
00:00:42,871 --> 00:00:49,321
Hence we immediately recognize it's a very abstract concept, but it has a lot of concrete applications.

10
00:00:49,914 --> 00:00:56,555
For example it's used a lot in physics and especially this notation you will see in quantum mechanics.

11
00:00:56,986 --> 00:01:04,283
As an example we can say in quantum mechanics, they would calculate the inner product of 2 states. Psi and Psi tilde

12
00:01:04,743 --> 00:01:08,461
and then they might say: this is the bracket notation of quantum mechanics,

13
00:01:08,661 --> 00:01:12,203
but mathematically it's just the inner product in a vector space.

14
00:01:12,714 --> 00:01:17,845
However, then in physics you also see a funny thing. They separate this bracket.

15
00:01:18,045 --> 00:01:26,969
On the one hand they say we have the called bra vector Psi and on the other hand the so called ket vector Psi tilde

16
00:01:27,514 --> 00:01:33,266
and then you can argue, putting both things together gives us a so called bra-ket.

17
00:01:33,466 --> 00:01:38,121
In short you can just say, this is another way to explain the inner product.

18
00:01:38,686 --> 00:01:42,590
In physics this is usually called the so called Dirac notation

19
00:01:42,943 --> 00:01:49,201
and if you want to learn more about this and inner products, I have a whole functional analysis course you can watch.

20
00:01:49,543 --> 00:01:54,403
So I really hope that I see you there or in the next video about mathematical symbols.

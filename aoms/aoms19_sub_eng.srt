Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:02,371 --> 00:00:05,957
and the mathematical symbol of today is Euler's phi function.

3
00:00:06,129 --> 00:00:08,251
Denoted with a lower case phi.

4
00:00:09,257 --> 00:00:14,057
It's also called Euler's totient function and used in number theory.

5
00:00:14,943 --> 00:00:19,605
Therefore the domain of the function is given by the positive integers.

6
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:24,006
So we have the natural numbers N. Starting with 1.

7
00:00:24,943 --> 00:00:28,189
and also the codomain is given by the natural numbers.

8
00:00:29,157 --> 00:00:33,989
Now of course the question here should be: What is the definition of phi of n?

9
00:00:34,614 --> 00:00:40,061
and the short answer is that we simply have to count numbers with 2 properties.

10
00:00:40,886 --> 00:00:45,959
So lets use the letter "a" for the numbers we count and then i explain the 2 properties.

11
00:00:46,743 --> 00:00:51,900
The first one is very simple. We only consider numbers that are less or equal than n.

12
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:57,734
This means that the outcome of the phi function can never be greater than the input.

13
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:04,574
Then the second property tells us that "a" and n don't have a single common divisor.

14
00:01:05,357 --> 00:01:08,947
Of course except 1, because 1 divides everything.

15
00:01:09,857 --> 00:01:14,043
Hence we can write this as the greatest common divisor.

16
00:01:14,629 --> 00:01:17,284
gcd of "a" and n.

17
00:01:18,343 --> 00:01:20,157
Is equal to 1.

18
00:01:21,229 --> 00:01:25,585
In mathematics then we say that "a" and n are mutually prime.

19
00:01:26,743 --> 00:01:32,417
Now if you have never seen this greatest common divisor then i think examples will help.

20
00:01:33,014 --> 00:01:35,773
For example what is phi of 4?

21
00:01:36,557 --> 00:01:42,918
Now, because of property 1 we already know we only have to look at the numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4.

22
00:01:43,543 --> 00:01:49,853
Of course property 2 immediately tells us that the number itself so 4 here can not be counted.

23
00:01:50,671 --> 00:01:56,942
Indeed you see the gcd(4, 4) would be 4 again. Not 1.

24
00:01:57,886 --> 00:02:02,143
However then you also see that 1 does not have any divisors.

25
00:02:02,228 --> 00:02:05,251
Therefore it always fulfils both properties. 

26
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:10,894
Then in the next step we have to exclude 2, because 2 times 2 is 4.

27
00:02:12,129 --> 00:02:17,604
Ok then looking at 3 we see there is no common divisor greater than 1.

28
00:02:18,257 --> 00:02:24,466
and now you see when we count the numbers that remain that fulfil both properties we get out 2.

29
00:02:25,157 --> 00:02:27,731
Hence phi of 4 is 2

30
00:02:28,443 --> 00:02:32,079
So maybe lets look at another example. So lets choose 5.

31
00:02:33,071 --> 00:02:38,273
Now we can look at the list again, but maybe you already know that 5 is a prime number.

32
00:02:39,143 --> 00:02:43,031
Hence the only number in the list we can cancel would be 5.

33
00:02:44,271 --> 00:02:47,355
Therefore finally we count 4 numbers.

34
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:55,515
In fact with this reasoning here we can immediately calculate phi of p. When p is a prime number.

35
00:02:56,614 --> 00:02:59,977
and now you know this should be (p - 1).

36
00:03:00,843 --> 00:03:07,702
Now there a lot of other nice properties for Euler's phi function, but maybe this is good enough for this video.

37
00:03:08,629 --> 00:03:11,084
Therefore i hope that i see you next time.

38
00:03:11,284 --> 00:03:12,157
Bye!

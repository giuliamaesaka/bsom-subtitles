Hello and welcome back to the next mathematical symbol.

2
00:00:03,729 --> 00:00:07,501
Which is the d'Alembert operator denoted by such a box.

3
00:00:07,701 --> 00:00:12,747
You might already know, mathematicians often use this box to denote the end of a proof,

4
00:00:12,947 --> 00:00:19,026
but here we will talk about another usage of this symbol. Namely we talk about the differential operator.

5
00:00:19,514 --> 00:00:24,769
Indeed, this d'Alembert operator is often used for applications in physics.

6
00:00:24,986 --> 00:00:32,489
More precisely it's often used as a differentiable operator when we have 3 dimensions in space and 1 dimension in time,

7
00:00:33,014 --> 00:00:37,867
because then we are able to combine some seconde order derivatives.

8
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:45,704
First we have the one with respect to the time variable t minus the ones with respect to the spatial variables

9
00:00:46,214 --> 00:00:51,400
and they are simply put into a Laplacian, the three dimensional Laplace operator.

10
00:00:51,929 --> 00:00:56,499
So there you should know, this is simply the sum of 3 partial derivatives

11
00:00:57,114 --> 00:01:02,313
and you see, usually we call the 3 dimensions in space x_1, x_2, x_3.

12
00:01:02,957 --> 00:01:07,011
Hence what happens here is that we connect space, time.

13
00:01:07,211 --> 00:01:11,902
So the d'Alembert operator is used when you want to describe something in space-time.

14
00:01:12,371 --> 00:01:20,459
For this reason the units where we measure space and time, should coincide and therefore the speed of light should occur somewhere.

15
00:01:20,886 --> 00:01:24,870
Indeed often we just put it in front of the time derivative.

16
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:30,687
So you find 1 over c^2 there, where c stands for the speed of light.

17
00:01:31,157 --> 00:01:37,071
Ok, there we have it. This is the meaning of the box, when we use it as a differential operator

18
00:01:37,271 --> 00:01:41,782
and then I would say, let's meet in the next video about mathematical symbols.

19
00:01:41,886 --> 00:01:42,800
Bye!

Hello and welcome back to the next mathematical symbol.

2
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:05,945
Which is the set symbol N

3
00:00:06,145 --> 00:00:11,251
and throughout mathematics it always denotes the so called natural numbers.

4
00:00:11,671 --> 00:00:15,814
They are called natural, because you use them for counting.

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:21,371
However, sadly there is no consensus with which number you should start counting.

6
00:00:21,782 --> 00:00:25,624
Therefore you usually find 2 competing definitions.

7
00:00:25,824 --> 00:00:30,571
On the one hand the one where we first count 1 object, then 2 and so on

8
00:00:31,343 --> 00:00:37,443
and on the other hand we have the definition where also no objects at all are represented with a 0.

9
00:00:37,929 --> 00:00:41,221
So there we have 0, 1, 2 and so on.

10
00:00:41,843 --> 00:00:49,030
Therefore if you start reading a mathematical book, you always should check and make sure which of both definitions is used.

11
00:00:49,514 --> 00:00:53,371
For example if the first notation for the natural numbers here is used,

12
00:00:53,510 --> 00:01:00,094
then also the second set is important and usually gets a new name. Like N with index 0.

13
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:08,542
This happens, because the natural numbers including the 0 element represent a very important mathematical structure.

14
00:01:09,314 --> 00:01:11,890
Namely it is a so called monoid.

15
00:01:12,257 --> 00:01:16,365
More precisely it's a monoid with respect to the addition.

16
00:01:16,565 --> 00:01:22,382
So there is an important fact. In the set of the natural numbers we know what the addition means.

17
00:01:22,971 --> 00:01:28,253
This I don't have to tell you. I assume that you know what it means when you have to add numbers.

18
00:01:28,771 --> 00:01:32,786
However if you want an explanation for this, an axiomatic approach,

19
00:01:32,957 --> 00:01:37,094
I have a whole video course about it called "start learning number".

20
00:01:37,657 --> 00:01:43,916
But most importantly after you know how the addition is defined, we find 2 properties for it.

21
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:49,826
First we find it's an associative operator when we add 3 numbers.

22
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:58,968
So we have a,b and c as natural numbers and then we get the equality for these 2 expressions, where we just add the 3 numbers.

23
00:01:59,414 --> 00:02:04,920
So it means we can set parentheses as we want, without changing the result

24
00:02:05,457 --> 00:02:09,133
and now exactly this property is called associativity.

25
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:13,758
Ok and this is the first part we have for a so called monoid

26
00:02:14,257 --> 00:02:17,882
and the second part is that a so called neutral element exist.

27
00:02:18,757 --> 00:02:25,824
Often it's also called the identity element and it just means that it doesn't change the element in the addition

28
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,711
and now for our natural numbers here, this is of course the number 0.

29
00:02:31,343 --> 00:02:37,672
So "a" + 0 is "a" again and also from the other side. 0 + "a" is also "a"

30
00:02:37,871 --> 00:02:41,377
and this holds no matter which natural number "a" we choose

31
00:02:41,577 --> 00:02:46,935
and with this you now know the definition of the mathematical concept called a monoid

32
00:02:47,135 --> 00:02:53,362
and moreover you also know an important example. The natural numbers including the 0 element

33
00:02:53,814 --> 00:02:58,183
and now if you want to learn more about the natural numbers, you can watch my other videos

34
00:02:58,383 --> 00:03:02,054
or otherwise we meet in the next video about mathematical symbols.

35
00:03:02,254 --> 00:03:04,971
Have a nice day and bye!

Hello and welcome back to the next mathematical symbol.

2
00:00:03,739 --> 00:00:06,380
Which is today the empty set symbol.

3
00:00:07,114 --> 00:00:12,203
Usually it's denoted like this, but sometimes you also see just this set brackets

4
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:18,157
and as the name tells us, both things just denote a set, which is empty.

5
00:00:18,414 --> 00:00:21,327
So it's a set with no elements at all.

6
00:00:21,527 --> 00:00:28,196
This means the logical statement given by "x is an element of the empty set" is always false

7
00:00:28,396 --> 00:00:34,064
and exactly because of this result, you can formulate some strange statements for the empty set.

8
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:43,875
So for example you can say: "for all x in the empty set it holds, if x an even number it's also an odd number".

9
00:00:44,543 --> 00:00:49,913
So at first glance it looks false, but it's indeed a true logical statement.

10
00:00:50,243 --> 00:00:54,791
Simply because there are no elements x in the given set here.

11
00:00:54,991 --> 00:00:57,632
Hence it does not matter what we claim here.

12
00:00:58,071 --> 00:01:00,679
In fact this is what can happen in mathematics.

13
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:08,417
That you prove a very surprising statement, but then it turns out that you have actually proven it just for the empty set

14
00:01:08,771 --> 00:01:12,083
and then the claim does not hold any information at all.

15
00:01:12,743 --> 00:01:17,020
Ok and with this I would say we have learned what the empty set symbol is

16
00:01:17,343 --> 00:01:23,018
and if you want to learn more details, I have a whole course about this called "start learning sets".

17
00:01:23,443 --> 00:01:27,954
So I hope that I meet you there or in the next video about mathematical symbols.

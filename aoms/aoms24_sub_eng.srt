Hello and welcome to the last video of this series in this year.

2
00:00:06,043 --> 00:00:11,386
Therefore it's the perfect moment thanking all the nice supporters on Steady and Paypal.

3
00:00:11,502 --> 00:00:13,914
You made all these videos possible.

4
00:00:14,814 --> 00:00:19,980
and now i can tell you the mathematical symbol of today is the infinity symbol.

5
00:00:20,986 --> 00:00:24,081
It's a symbol that is used throughout mathematics,

6
00:00:24,281 --> 00:00:27,914
because it represents the concept of infinity.

7
00:00:28,714 --> 00:00:33,866
Of course then the specific meaning, when it is used, depends on the context.

8
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:41,077
Indeed most of the time it just should remind us that some infinity is at work.

9
00:00:41,543 --> 00:00:50,393
For example if you want to write down the limit of a sequence, you would write limit n goes to infinity.

10
00:00:51,571 --> 00:00:57,730
and here in our example if the sequence is 1 over n, you know the limit is 0.

11
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:03,226
Now here you should see there is no need to use the symbol infinity here

12
00:01:03,426 --> 00:01:05,729
because we know the definition of a limit.

13
00:01:07,014 --> 00:01:13,629
However this symbol is there to tell us that a number n should increase and increase without stopping.

14
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:18,729
So in this case infinity is not a number we just put into the sequence.

15
00:01:19,786 --> 00:01:23,186
Rather infinity is used in a symbolic way here.

16
00:01:24,343 --> 00:01:30,885
In fact this is often the case, but sometimes we need to calculate with the symbol infinity.

17
00:01:31,786 --> 00:01:35,055
and then of course it acts more like a number.

18
00:01:36,143 --> 00:01:40,101
One important application of this you find in measure theory,

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,004
because there we need to calculate with numbers from 0 to infinity.

20
00:01:46,204 --> 00:01:49,714
and 0 and infinity are included in the interval.

21
00:01:50,671 --> 00:01:55,749
One short explanation here is that in measure theory we deal with volumes.

22
00:01:56,543 --> 00:02:02,514
and of course it could happen that the volume is 0, but we also deal with infinite volumes.

23
00:02:03,514 --> 00:02:09,385
and then in calculations that occur we need to add volumes and multiply them.

24
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:16,088
Therefore we need a meaning for "a + infinity" and "a times infinity".

25
00:02:16,971 --> 00:02:23,941
So lets start with the first one. So "a + infinity" should of course be the same as "infinity + a".

26
00:02:24,457 --> 00:02:31,357
and now because we see infinity as the largest number in our interval, this should be infinity again.

27
00:02:32,529 --> 00:02:37,186
Indeed this should also hold when "a" was infinity at the beginning.

28
00:02:37,929 --> 00:02:43,343
Or to put it in other words. Infinity + infinity should be infinity again.

29
00:02:44,514 --> 00:02:50,730
and there you already see the only meaningful thing for two times infinity is infinity again.

30
00:02:51,729 --> 00:02:55,771
In fact this should be our definition for all numbers "a".

31
00:02:55,857 --> 00:02:57,700
Including infinity.

32
00:02:58,486 --> 00:03:03,170
So infinity times infinity is again infinity.

33
00:03:04,143 --> 00:03:09,514
However here one question remains: what to do with 0 times infinity?

34
00:03:10,471 --> 00:03:15,707
Usually for example when you deal with limits this expression is not well defined,

35
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:20,657
but in measure theory it makes sense to define it.

36
00:03:21,443 --> 00:03:25,402
Indeed there 0 times infinity should be 0.

37
00:03:26,171 --> 00:03:30,179
This definition makes some formulas in measure theory simpler.

38
00:03:30,786 --> 00:03:32,805
Therefore it's very helpful there.

39
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:41,713
Now having these definitions now you can check that we still have commutative laws associative laws and distributive laws.

40
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:49,023
Or in other words some calculation rules still hold when we deal with infinity in this way.

41
00:03:49,586 --> 00:03:55,230
Of course if you want to know more about measure theory, you can look at my whole series about it.

42
00:03:55,957 --> 00:04:00,214
Ok and with this i really hope you learned something in this series here.

43
00:04:01,229 --> 00:04:03,576
I wish you all the best and see you next time.

44
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:04,586
Bye! :)

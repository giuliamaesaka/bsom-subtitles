1
00:00:00,457 --> 00:00:03,800
The mathematical symbol of today is the Kronecker delta.

2
00:00:03,1000 --> 00:00:07,031
Written as lower case delta_i_j.

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:10,438
And the definition is not complicated at all.

4
00:00:10,439 --> 00:00:12,639
It's either 1 or 0.

5
00:00:13,786 --> 00:00:17,591
Indeed it's only 1, when i = j

6
00:00:18,557 --> 00:00:21,582
and in all other cases it's equal to 0.

7
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,713
This means that you can use the Kronecker delta for a lot of possibilities

8
00:00:26,913 --> 00:00:29,878
So for a lot of different indices "i" and "j".

9
00:00:30,571 --> 00:00:35,305
The only thing that is required is that equality of the indices make sense.

10
00:00:36,471 --> 00:00:40,561
In fact most of the time "i" and "j" represent integers.

11
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:47,284
For example when you write delta_1_2, it just stands for the number 0.

12
00:00:48,286 --> 00:00:52,821
On the other hand delta_5_5 stands for the number 1.

13
00:00:53,614 --> 00:00:57,214
So you see the kronecker delta is a very simple symbol, 

14
00:00:57,414 --> 00:01:02,137
but nevertheless it can be very helpful when you calculate with sums, for example.

15
00:01:02,757 --> 00:01:09,732
This means in the case you have a complicated sum, where kronecker delta is involved usually you can simplify it.

16
00:01:10,171 --> 00:01:13,284
So for this double sum from 1 to 5,

17
00:01:13,484 --> 00:01:15,443
where delta_i_j is involved.

18
00:01:15,686 --> 00:01:17,906
Most of the terms are 0.

19
00:01:18,557 --> 00:01:22,415
Therefore what comes out here is simply the number 5.

20
00:01:23,543 --> 00:01:26,197
Ok, that's the Kronecker delta.

21
00:01:26,397 --> 00:01:27,615
Thanks for listening.

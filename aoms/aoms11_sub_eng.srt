00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:03,821
The mathematical symbol of today is the set bracket.

2
00:00:04,021 --> 00:00:06,849
Which we use in mathematics to construct new sets.

3
00:00:07,614 --> 00:00:13,564
For example you often see something like this, that after the set bracket we have a function f(x).

4
00:00:14,571 --> 00:00:18,232
and then on the right you see a vertical line or a colon.

5
00:00:18,571 --> 00:00:24,286
Moreover next to it you find something like: x is an element in a set "A".

6
00:00:25,286 --> 00:00:30,526
Of course there could be more conditions than this, but in the end we have a closing set bracket.

7
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:40,763
Now the meaning of this is that we apply the function f to all elements x from the set "A" and then we form a new set.

8
00:00:41,614 --> 00:00:45,741
and the elements of the new set are exactly these values.

9
00:00:46,386 --> 00:00:52,445
So you could read it as the set of the elements f(x), where x comes from "A".

10
00:00:53,114 --> 00:00:56,742
Indeed this is a construction you see very often in mathematics.

11
00:00:57,186 --> 00:01:00,425
Therefore it might be helpful to look immediately at an example.

12
00:01:01,243 --> 00:01:07,606
So lets look at a set of the elements where the function f is given by (2 times x + 1).

13
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:14,335
and here x should come from the set {0, 1, 2, 3}.

14
00:01:14,886 --> 00:01:20,331
So you see we construct a new set using this set here and that function.

15
00:01:21,314 --> 00:01:26,931
and now you should see the values that come out are just the first 4 odd numbers.

16
00:01:28,057 --> 00:01:30,822
Hence 1, 3, 5, 7.

17
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:35,671
For example 7 we get when we apply this 3 here.

18
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:43,610
So you see this construction is not so complicated, but it occurs very often. Therefore you should know what it means.

19
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:51,047
As a fun fact i can tell you this set construction is also included in the programming language Python.

20
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:59,077
So you can use the curly brackets { and type "2 times x + 1 for 

21
00:02:00,386 --> 00:02:03,408
So you can see the "for" as the vertical line.

22
00:02:04,329 --> 00:02:11,900
and then we just type "x in the set {0, 1, 2, 3} curly brackets.

23
00:02:11,957 --> 00:02:12,786
curly brackets

24
00:02:13,643 --> 00:02:16,729
Ok now i hit enter and you see the result.

25
00:02:17,957 --> 00:02:22,461
So not so surprising we get the same odd numbers, we calculated before.

26
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:27,540
Ok i hope that this was helpful and that i see you in the next video.

27
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:28,514
Bye!

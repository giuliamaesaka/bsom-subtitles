00:00:00,729 --> 00:00:04,571
The mathematical Symbol of today is the so called Gamma function.

2
00:00:04,686 --> 00:00:06,309
Written with a capital Gamma.

3
00:00:07,429 --> 00:00:11,709
and the name of the variable we put in is usually given by z.

4
00:00:12,443 --> 00:00:18,077
Now the explicit definition of the Gamma function is not so simple, because it's given by an integral.

5
00:00:19,014 --> 00:00:22,408
Indeed we integrate from 0 to infinity.

6
00:00:23,171 --> 00:00:27,033
and the variable for the integration is given by x.

7
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:32,706
and the number z from the left hand side we find here in the exponent of x. 

8
00:00:33,614 --> 00:00:36,663
Because it's x to the power (z-1).

9
00:00:37,214 --> 00:00:41,794
Moreover this is then multiplied with e to the power (-x).

10
00:00:42,686 --> 00:00:48,471
So you see this is not a simple definition for a function and to make it even more complicated

11
00:00:48,472 --> 00:00:52,357
i can tell you this z could even be a complex number.

12
00:00:53,071 --> 00:00:57,202
However then we need that the real part of z is positive.

13
00:00:58,114 --> 00:01:02,640
Now this means it's a allowed to put in for example natural numbers.

14
00:01:03,514 --> 00:01:07,713
and indeed there we find a nice property for Gamma of n.

15
00:01:08,529 --> 00:01:13,434
Because one can show this is exactly (n-1)!

16
00:01:13,871 --> 00:01:18,593
Or in other words the Gamma function is a generalisation for the factorial.

17
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,884
and exactly this gets even more apparent when we prove a similar recursive formula.

18
00:01:25,729 --> 00:01:33,627
Which reads like Gamma of (z+1) is equal to z time Gamma of z.

19
00:01:34,786 --> 00:01:40,744
Of course the Gamma function has also other nice properties we can discuss in another video.

20
00:01:41,514 --> 00:01:45,300
However now you already know what the definition of the Gamma function is.

21
00:01:45,886 --> 00:01:49,260
So if this was helpful, then i see you next time.

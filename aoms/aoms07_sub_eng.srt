00:00:00,543 --> 00:00:03,714
The mathematical symbol of today is the sum symbol.

2
00:00:03,843 --> 00:00:05,722
Written as a capital Sigma.

3
00:00:06,557 --> 00:00:10,471
and below the Sigma, usually you find the name for an index.

4
00:00:10,472 --> 00:00:12,400
So fo example it could be "k".

5
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:19,430
and if you see k = 1, this means 1 is the starting value for the variable "k".

6
00:00:19,843 --> 00:00:24,778
On the other hand, on the top of Sigma you find the n-th value for the variable "k".

7
00:00:25,557 --> 00:00:30,657
This means if this is the sum of the numbers "a_k". Then we get

8
00:00:31,414 --> 00:00:39,300
"a_1" + "a_2" + "a_3" + and so on. Until we reach "a_n".

9
00:00:40,629 --> 00:00:43,821
This means that we start with the index given here 

10
00:00:44,021 --> 00:00:45,425
Then we increase it by 1.

11
00:00:45,625 --> 00:00:46,493
Do the addition.

12
00:00:46,571 --> 00:00:52,577
Then we increase it by 1 again. Do the addition again. Until we reach the value for the index given here.

13
00:00:53,057 --> 00:00:57,081
So this whole thing here should explain what the sum symbol means.

14
00:00:57,657 --> 00:01:02,568
However in a formal way, you can also write down a recursive definition for this symbol.

15
00:01:03,414 --> 00:01:09,249
More concretely this means, first i tell you what happens when "n" here is equal to 0.

16
00:01:10,014 --> 00:01:17,516
Then the whole thing from above wouldn't make any sense, because by just increasing the index by 1 we would never reach 0 here.

17
00:01:18,214 --> 00:01:24,029
However in this case we define it as the empty sum. Which means it should be 0.

18
00:01:25,071 --> 00:01:29,438
In other words if we don't sum anything we stay at the value 0.

19
00:01:30,286 --> 00:01:36,114
and then in the second step for recursive definition, we need to know what happens to the successor.

20
00:01:36,649 --> 00:01:42,013
Or more precisely the successor n is defined by the predecessor n-1.

21
00:01:42,957 --> 00:01:52,515
Indeed this is not hard to understand. If we have this sum from k = 1 to (n - 1), we just have to add the last term to get this sum.

22
00:01:53,343 --> 00:01:57,019
and then you see this is our recursive definition for the sum symbol.

23
00:01:58,071 --> 00:02:04,105
and with this you shouldn't have any problems generalising this to other starter indices here.

24
00:02:04,657 --> 00:02:08,499
Ok, so i hope i see you in the next video. Bye!

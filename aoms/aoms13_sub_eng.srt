hello and welcome.

2
00:00:02,186 --> 00:00:05,649
The mathematical symbol of today is the binomial coefficient.

3
00:00:05,849 --> 00:00:07,336
Written with parentheses.

4
00:00:08,529 --> 00:00:13,388
and there at the top we find an integer n and at the bottom an integer k.

5
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:18,647
Now usually you read this binomial coefficient as "n choose k".

6
00:00:19,257 --> 00:00:27,480
We do this, because it represents the number of possibilities to choose k elements from a fixed set with n elements.

7
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:32,721
Here i always think it's a good idea to visualize this with an example.

8
00:00:33,443 --> 00:00:37,783
So here you see we have 7 balls. So n is equal to 7.

9
00:00:38,771 --> 00:00:43,943
and now i tell you we take 3 of them out. So k is equal to 3.

10
00:00:44,971 --> 00:00:49,640
Here maybe one possibility would be to get 2, 3 and 6.

11
00:00:50,314 --> 00:00:52,756
and please note here there is no order involved.

12
00:00:52,786 --> 00:00:55,135
So we take them out with one pick.

13
00:00:55,943 --> 00:00:59,000
Of course still there are a lot of other examples.

14
00:00:59,157 --> 00:01:01,216
Maybe 5, 6 and 7.

15
00:01:01,971 --> 00:01:07,586
and now the question the binomial coefficient answers, is how many possibilities there are.

16
00:01:08,629 --> 00:01:12,097
Therefore i would suggest trying to calculate them.

17
00:01:12,729 --> 00:01:16,629
So here you see 3 empty slots that we can fill in with numbers.

18
00:01:17,929 --> 00:01:23,431
Now if we just take out one ball then we could have any number here in the first position.

19
00:01:24,643 --> 00:01:28,655
Hence counting the possibilities we have exactly n here.

20
00:01:29,429 --> 00:01:32,414
Then for the second position we take out another ball.

21
00:01:33,629 --> 00:01:39,400
However now the first ball is already gone. So we have exactly (n - 1) numbers.

22
00:01:40,414 --> 00:01:44,486
and finally for the third position (n - 2) numbers remain.

23
00:01:45,671 --> 00:01:53,639
Now multiplying these numbers gives us exactly the possibilities for filling in these slots with the balls here.

24
00:01:54,886 --> 00:01:58,485
However then you might see we have an order involved.

25
00:01:59,629 --> 00:02:05,542
Therefore we have to divide this thing here by the number of orders we have for these slots.

26
00:02:06,429 --> 00:02:09,670
Indeed the reasoning now is similar to before.

27
00:02:10,471 --> 00:02:15,655
If you want to rearrange the first ball, the first slot, you have 3 positions to choose.

28
00:02:16,586 --> 00:02:21,137
Then for the second only 2 remain and for the last one only 1 remains.

29
00:02:22,486 --> 00:02:26,400
and with this we have it. This is what the binomial coefficient should do.

30
00:02:27,243 --> 00:02:37,015
So in general here we would have: n times (n - 1) times (n - 2) and so on until we reach (n - k + 1).

31
00:02:37,971 --> 00:02:41,709
So you should see this is the generalisation of our example.

32
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:46,510
and moreover then we would find k! in the denominator.

33
00:02:47,657 --> 00:02:53,213
So indeed this is the definition of the binomial coefficient "n choose k".

34
00:02:53,943 --> 00:02:57,671
and for the end i can tell you there is a shorter definition for this.

35
00:02:58,586 --> 00:03:07,439
Namely we have n! divided by k! as before and also (n - k)!.

36
00:03:08,386 --> 00:03:13,025
There you should see these 2 parts here just cancel to get you this.

37
00:03:13,771 --> 00:03:16,057
Ok so this is the binomial coefficient.

38
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,500
and i hope that you learned something today.

39
00:03:19,386 --> 00:03:21,002
Then see you next time.

40
00:03:21,202 --> 00:03:21,829
Bye!

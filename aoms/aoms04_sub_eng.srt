1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,788
The mathematical symbol of today is the factorial.

2
00:00:03,988 --> 00:00:06,059
Which is written with an exclamation mark.

3
00:00:07,157 --> 00:00:10,136
and usually you see the definition for a natural number n.

4
00:00:11,357 --> 00:00:18,243
This is because this n with an exclamation mark, represents a product with exactly n factors.

5
00:00:18,929 --> 00:00:23,626
We start with the number n itself. Then we reduce the number by 1

6
00:00:24,457 --> 00:00:29,016
and then we continue this whole procedure until we reach the number 1.

7
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:36,762
This means when you see this definition, you know we need a positive integer n such that this makes sense.

8
00:00:37,714 --> 00:00:40,471
For example when you see 4!

9
00:00:40,571 --> 00:00:45,343
This just means you have 4 times 3 times 2 times 1.

10
00:00:46,214 --> 00:00:49,068
Which is, as one can remember 24.

11
00:00:50,486 --> 00:00:54,770
also you should remember 1! is just 1.

12
00:00:55,614 --> 00:01:01,282
Now what you see here with the factorial is what in mathematics we call a recursive definition.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,228
This means that we first fix a starting value and indeed we can do this with 0.

14
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,287
Here 0! should be defined as 1.

15
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:17,443
This makes sense for a lot of formulas, so this is indeed something you really should remember.

16
00:01:18,343 --> 00:01:24,977
and then the next step in the recursive definition is saying what happens with the successor of a given natural number.

17
00:01:25,714 --> 00:01:30,284
So n! should be n times (n-1)!

18
00:01:30,943 --> 00:01:36,378
So when we know what the factorial does to (n-1), we also know what it does to n.

19
00:01:37,157 --> 00:01:43,212
and because we have a starting value, we now could calculate the values for all other natural numbers n.

20
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:50,069
Ok, this is the definition for the factorial. Which you can apply for natural numbers n.

21
00:01:50,886 --> 00:01:53,468
Thanks for listening and see you next time.

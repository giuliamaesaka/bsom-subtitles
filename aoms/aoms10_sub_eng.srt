The mathematical symbol of today is a lower case sigma with an index.

2
00:00:05,686 --> 00:00:07,927
Which stands for a Pauli Matrix.

3
00:00:08,771 --> 00:00:13,456
Indeed there are 3 Pauli matrices. Sigma_1, sigma_2 and sigma_3.

4
00:00:14,057 --> 00:00:19,310
And they are very important if you do physics. Especially quantum mechanics.

5
00:00:20,329 --> 00:00:26,543
However of course they are given as mathematical objects, because they are defined as 2x2 matrices.

6
00:00:27,143 --> 00:00:29,729
Therefore they are actually not so complicated.

7
00:00:30,129 --> 00:00:33,148
For example sigma_1 is given as 0, 1.

8
00:00:33,343 --> 00:00:34,742
1, 0.

9
00:00:35,886 --> 00:00:41,456
Then sigma_2 look similarly, but there we need the imaginary unit "i".

10
00:00:42,029 --> 00:00:44,133
So we have 0, -i

11
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:45,900
i, 0.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:54,074
and then the last one sigma_3 is simply given as 1, 0, 0, -1.

13
00:00:55,286 --> 00:01:01,643
Now the most important property for the Pauli matrices is that they all square to the identity matrix.

14
00:01:02,857 --> 00:01:10,372
Hence if you multiply the matrix with itself, you get out 1, 0, 0, 1.

15
00:01:11,157 --> 00:01:15,429
This is something that you can easily check for all 3 matrices.

16
00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:21,917
Now another question you could ask is: what happens when we multiply two different Pauli matrices?

17
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:27,139
and what i can immediately tell you there is that the order matters.

18
00:01:28,057 --> 00:01:36,208
So sigma_j on the left and sigma_k on the right is different from sigma_k on the left and sigma_j on the right.

19
00:01:36,771 --> 00:01:42,638
So what we get out here is not the 0 matrix, when k and j are not the same index.

20
00:01:43,657 --> 00:01:49,443
and indeed what you can show is, this is 2 times the imaginary unit i

21
00:01:49,814 --> 00:01:54,000
times the Levi-Civita symbol epsilon_jkl

22
00:01:54,771 --> 00:01:57,766
Times the Pauli matrix sigma_l.

23
00:01:58,729 --> 00:02:04,971
Now this nice equality holds for all possible combinations of the indices 1, 2, 3.

24
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:09,386
So maybe it's a good think to check it for some of them.

25
00:02:09,943 --> 00:02:13,610
Ok, now you know the beautiful Pauli matrices.

26
00:02:14,386 --> 00:02:18,795
and if this was helpful then i hope that i see you in the next video. 

27
00:02:18,995 --> 00:02:19,857
Bye!

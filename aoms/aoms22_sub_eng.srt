Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:02,335 --> 00:00:06,129
and the mathematical symbol of today is the so called Heaviside function.

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,302
Often denoted with a capital H.

4
00:00:09,214 --> 00:00:12,786
However you also often see the greek letter Theta.

5
00:00:13,686 --> 00:00:18,443
Moreover sometimes the Heaviside function is called the unit step function.

6
00:00:19,429 --> 00:00:23,783
This is because the definition of H(x) is very simple.

7
00:00:24,814 --> 00:00:26,507
There is just one step involved.

8
00:00:26,707 --> 00:00:28,319
So we can consider 2 cases.

9
00:00:29,143 --> 00:00:32,441
So either the function is 1 or 0.

10
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,586
and indeed the sign of x tells us in which case we are.

11
00:00:38,586 --> 00:00:43,078
Positive points get the value 1 and negative points get the value 0.

12
00:00:44,014 --> 00:00:47,883
Therefore only the question remains what to do with the point 0.

13
00:00:48,686 --> 00:00:51,429
and as you can see here we put it to 1.

14
00:00:51,888 --> 00:00:55,129
However there are also other conventions what to do.

15
00:00:55,232 --> 00:00:58,722
Sometimes x = 0 is set to 0.5.

16
00:00:59,714 --> 00:01:02,425
Then the value lies exactly in the middle here.

17
00:01:03,286 --> 00:01:10,214
However actually for a lot of applications it does not matter at all what we do with the point x = 0.

18
00:01:11,114 --> 00:01:14,244
The important thing is just that we have this step here.

19
00:01:15,343 --> 00:01:21,153
Hence the graph of the function looks very simple. We just have these 2 constant parts.

20
00:01:21,929 --> 00:01:24,525
Ok now you know the Heaviside function.

21
00:01:24,743 --> 00:01:29,862
Which is by the way not called Heaviside, because there is a heavy side in the graph.

22
00:01:30,786 --> 00:01:35,289
It's called Heaviside as in the mathematician Oliver Heaviside.

23
00:01:36,214 --> 00:01:40,558
Ok then just i tell you one last fun fact for the end of the video.

24
00:01:41,671 --> 00:01:45,943
You can calculate the derivative of H and you get something nice out.

25
00:01:46,743 --> 00:01:50,343
Of course what comes out should be 0 here and here

26
00:01:50,618 --> 00:01:53,457
and maybe not defined here at 0.

27
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,880
However this only happens if you do a classical derivative.

28
00:01:58,571 --> 00:02:02,229
What one can do is use the derivative for distributions.

29
00:02:02,943 --> 00:02:07,386
and then what comes out is the famous Dirac delta distribution.

30
00:02:08,271 --> 00:02:12,987
This is a really nice connection if you see both functions as distributions.

31
00:02:13,671 --> 00:02:18,386
In fact if you want to know more about distributions, i have a whole series about them.

32
00:02:19,543 --> 00:02:21,200
Therefore i hope i see you there.

33
00:02:21,729 --> 00:02:23,500
Have a nice day. Bye!

00:00:00,714 --> 00:00:03,714
The mathematical symbol of today is the product symbol.

2
00:00:03,771 --> 00:00:05,672
Written with a capital Pi.

3
00:00:06,186 --> 00:00:12,057
and in the same way as we have it for the sum symbol, we use an index below the letter Pi.

4
00:00:13,229 --> 00:00:20,857
So here k starts with the value 1 goes through all natural numbers until we reach the value n in the end.

5
00:00:21,629 --> 00:00:26,966
Hence this symbol here is a short notation for a product with exactly n factors.

6
00:00:27,857 --> 00:00:34,377
More precisely we start with "a_1" times "a_2" times "a_3" and so on.

7
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,633
Until we reach "a_n".

8
00:00:37,414 --> 00:00:44,227
Of course "a_1", "a_2" and so on could be any numbers. The thing important is only that we have an index involved.

9
00:00:45,043 --> 00:00:50,154
On the left hand side we call it k, but of course any other name would do it as well.

10
00:00:50,971 --> 00:00:55,038
Now you can see the whole thing here as an explanation for the product symbol,

11
00:00:55,129 --> 00:00:59,067
but the formal definition should be given by a recursive definition.

12
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:04,395
This means that we first have to explain what the empty product should be.

13
00:01:04,971 --> 00:01:08,335
In other words what happens when we set n to 0.

14
00:01:09,214 --> 00:01:14,714
Then the explanation from above does not make any sense, because there are no numbers involved.

15
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:20,509
Indeed the only meaningful thing would be to set the empty product to 1.

16
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,076
Because when we multiply with 1, we don't change anything.

17
00:01:25,957 --> 00:01:33,699
and now you might already know for recursive definition, we have to say what happens to the successor, when we know the predecessor.

18
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:40,743
This means that here on the right hand side we have the product that goes through k = 1 to (n - 1)

19
00:01:40,814 --> 00:01:45,529
and we want to reach this product, where k goes from 1 to n.

20
00:01:45,971 --> 00:01:51,834
and of course the only meaningful thing would be to multiply on the right hand side with "a_n".

21
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:55,094
Ok and that's the recursive definition.

22
00:01:56,271 --> 00:02:01,170
and of course if we want we can easily generalize this to other starting values.

23
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,291
So this is the product symbol.

24
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:08,070
and if this was helpful i see you in the next video.

25
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:09,330
Bye!

Hello and welcome back to the next mathematical symbol.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,897
Which is today this partial d.

3
00:00:06,471 --> 00:00:11,715
I just call it partial d, but there are a lot of other names for this cursive d.

4
00:00:12,143 --> 00:00:16,275
However it's important to see that it's not a lower case delta.

5
00:00:16,814 --> 00:00:22,300
Of course it's related, because it should look like a rounded version of a lower case d.

6
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:28,578
Indeed some people just call this symbol del, but this can be confused with the nabla operator.

7
00:00:29,343 --> 00:00:33,597
Therefore if you pronounce this letter here, you can simply say d

8
00:00:33,797 --> 00:00:39,037
and now you might already know, we mostly use this symbol when we talk about partial derivatives.

9
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:46,946
So for example, if we have a function from R^2 to R, we can form the derivative with respect to the first variable here

10
00:00:47,343 --> 00:00:51,416
and this is then the partial derivative, denoted with the curved d.

11
00:00:51,616 --> 00:00:54,918
So we have df over dx_1

12
00:00:55,329 --> 00:01:00,939
and then we simply say: this is the partial derivative of f with respect to x_1

13
00:01:01,771 --> 00:01:08,770
and there you see, we use this curved d to distinguish the partial derivative from a normal derivative in 1 variable.

14
00:01:09,286 --> 00:01:13,746
However, our partial d here is also used in other contexts.

15
00:01:14,386 --> 00:01:18,816
So for example in topology we talk about open and closed sets

16
00:01:19,016 --> 00:01:26,306
and then it turns out that for each subset in a given space, we can define the so called boundary of the set.

17
00:01:26,886 --> 00:01:31,272
In this picture here, we would visualize it as the shell of the given set A

18
00:01:31,657 --> 00:01:35,392
and then we denote this boundary by partial dA.

19
00:01:35,886 --> 00:01:42,259
So you see this is a completely different usage of this curved d, then we have it for the partial derivatives.

20
00:01:42,929 --> 00:01:48,091
Now, if you know other cases where the partial d is used, you can tell me in the comments.

21
00:01:48,529 --> 00:01:53,113
Otherwise I would say let's meet in the next video about mathematical symbols.

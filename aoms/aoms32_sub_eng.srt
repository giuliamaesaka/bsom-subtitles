Hello and welcome back to the next mathematical symbol.

2
00:00:03,557 --> 00:00:06,738
Which is the integral sign with this circle inside.

3
00:00:07,014 --> 00:00:11,910
So you see, this is a variation from the integral sign, from the last video

4
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:18,266
and here the circle always tells you that the integration is closed in some sense.

5
00:00:18,466 --> 00:00:23,098
For example often it denotes a so called "closed line integral".

6
00:00:23,557 --> 00:00:30,022
There we simply have a curve in some space. For example the plane and we integrate along it

7
00:00:30,222 --> 00:00:37,515
and exactly this is what we would call a line integral and most importantly, it has a starting point and an end point

8
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:44,810
and now this circle here gives the additional information that the start point and the end point coincide.

9
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:49,873
So a closed integral means that the curve ends where it started.

10
00:00:50,073 --> 00:00:57,103
So indeed the curve could look complicated. It's just important that we find the end point at the beginning again.

11
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:05,132
Ok and now it turns out that these integrals occur so often that it's useful to introduce a new symbol for them.

12
00:01:05,332 --> 00:01:12,233
For example in complex analysis it turns out that this closed line integral carries a lot of information.

13
00:01:12,433 --> 00:01:19,173
You can look at a function 1/z and then it turns out that this closed line integral is not always 0.

14
00:01:19,373 --> 00:01:27,407
Indeed we find that for the circle that goes one time around the origin, this integral is exactly 2*pi*i.

15
00:01:28,057 --> 00:01:31,901
So this is what we can easily calculate in the complex plane

16
00:01:32,101 --> 00:01:37,797
and if you want to learn more about this, I have a whole video course about complex analysis.

17
00:01:38,171 --> 00:01:42,352
So let's meet there or in the next video about mathematical symbols.

18
00:01:42,552 --> 00:01:44,286
Have a nice day and bye.

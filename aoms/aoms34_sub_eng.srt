Hello and welcome back to the mathematical symbol which is given by the set letter Z

2
00:00:06,543 --> 00:00:11,963
and this symbol represents the integers, also sometimes called the whole numbers.

3
00:00:12,486 --> 00:00:17,603
It means it's a set of numbers that extends the set of the natural numbers.

4
00:00:18,057 --> 00:00:23,969
Namely by also including the negative numbers, like -2, -1 and so on

5
00:00:24,169 --> 00:00:30,305
and important to remember is that we have all the natural numbers including 0 in this set.

6
00:00:30,505 --> 00:00:36,622
Now, indeed this object Z forms a common example for a very important mathematical concept.

7
00:00:37,143 --> 00:00:41,371
It's essential throughout mathematics and it's the so called "group".

8
00:00:41,763 --> 00:00:47,386
However, here it's important to know that a set can only be a group if it has an additional structure.

9
00:00:47,529 --> 00:00:49,958
Here given by the addition, +

10
00:00:50,158 --> 00:00:57,478
and then if we have this additional operation together with 3 properties we can say that we have a group.

11
00:00:57,678 --> 00:01:01,271
Now the first property is that the operation is associative.

12
00:01:01,471 --> 00:01:09,640
Which means if we add up three elements, then we can set the parentheses as we want without changing the result.

13
00:01:10,057 --> 00:01:17,758
So again here you see a, b, c are integers and this is the formulation of the associativity rule.

14
00:01:17,958 --> 00:01:24,714
Ok and then the next property is that we have an identity element. Also often called a neutral element

15
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:30,865
and it just means that we have one element that does not change any element while using the addition

16
00:01:31,329 --> 00:01:36,056
and this you already know. It's the number 0 that fulfills this property.

17
00:01:36,871 --> 00:01:43,973
Ok and then finally, the last part is that for each element in a set, there exists a so called inverse element.

18
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:50,098
More precisely it means if you add both elements, you get out the neutral element.

19
00:01:50,543 --> 00:01:56,718
So it reads like: " a + (-a) or (-a) + a, gives us 0".

20
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:02,438
So what you should see here is, the inverse element of 2 is simply -2

21
00:02:02,638 --> 00:02:07,238
and on the other hand the inverse element of -1 is +1.

22
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:13,034
Moreover you also see that 0 has an inverse element, it's simply itself

23
00:02:13,234 --> 00:02:19,007
and indeed this is what we need here. All elements in a set must have an inverse element

24
00:02:19,571 --> 00:02:23,206
and only then we can call the whole thing a group.

25
00:02:23,371 --> 00:02:28,171
Now, if you want to know more about how to construct this group of the integers,

26
00:02:28,172 --> 00:02:32,586
I have a whole video series about this called "start learning numbers".

27
00:02:33,071 --> 00:02:37,386
So I either see you there or in the next video about mathematical symbols.

28
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,686
So have a nice day and bye.

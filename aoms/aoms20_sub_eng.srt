Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:02,314 --> 00:00:05,571
and the mathematical symbol of today is the laplace operator.

3
00:00:05,643 --> 00:00:07,274
Denoted with a capital Delta.

4
00:00:08,157 --> 00:00:12,594
This famous operator is also often called laplacian.

5
00:00:13,586 --> 00:00:19,853
and indeed there is no single laplace operator. There are a lot of different meanings depending on the context. 

6
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:32,333
However often the first time one sees triangle in mathematics or in physics is as an differential operator on the space R^3 or in general R^n.

7
00:00:33,386 --> 00:00:39,823
and then it simply acts on functions f defined on the space, but with values in R.

8
00:00:40,771 --> 00:00:46,629
Hence laplace f just denotes the new function also defined on R^3.

9
00:00:47,543 --> 00:00:51,904
So here the variable in R^3 is simply denoted by x.

10
00:00:52,671 --> 00:00:55,943
So we have components x_1, x_2 and x_3.

11
00:00:56,786 --> 00:01:01,305
Indeed with respect to these components we look at a partial derivative.

12
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:08,175
and the important thing to remember here is, for the laplacian we always look at the second derivative.

13
00:01:09,186 --> 00:01:14,699
So the first thing we have here is the second partial derivative with respect to x_1.

14
00:01:15,571 --> 00:01:18,643
and then you see we simply add the next one.

15
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:22,929
Which is the second partial derivative with respect to the second component.

16
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,740
and then we simply continue adding the second partial derivatives,

17
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:32,621
until we reach the second partial derivative with respect to the last component.

18
00:01:33,671 --> 00:01:38,543
So therefore please remember here we don't have mixed second partial derivatives.

19
00:01:39,371 --> 00:01:43,740
However all the other once, the unmixed once, are added.

20
00:01:44,714 --> 00:01:51,298
Therefore now i think you shouldn't have any problems writing down the laplace operator defined on R^n.

21
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:56,960
Ok and with this i hope that you learned something today and that i see you next time.

22
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:57,900
Bye!

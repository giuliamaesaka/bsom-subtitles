The mathematical symbol of today is the convolution.

2
00:00:04,043 --> 00:00:06,086
Denoted with such a star.

3
00:00:07,129 --> 00:00:11,800
In fact in mathematics you find different possibilities to define the convolution.

4
00:00:11,956 --> 00:00:14,449
Depending which problem you consider.

5
00:00:15,457 --> 00:00:19,554
Most importantly you find a continuous version and a discrete version.

6
00:00:20,586 --> 00:00:24,143
Now in this video i want to show you the ordinary continuous version.

7
00:00:24,257 --> 00:00:28,429
So we consider functions f and g defined on the real number line.

8
00:00:29,871 --> 00:00:35,148
Then for these two functions we define the convolution of f and g.

9
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:42,142
In fact this convolution should give us a new function also defined on the real number line. 

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,515
More precisely "f star g" is again a function from R to R.

11
00:00:49,686 --> 00:00:54,988
and the idea to get this new function is to mix f and g together.

12
00:00:55,657 --> 00:01:00,642
Moreover this mixing works in two different directions inside the integral.

13
00:01:01,457 --> 00:01:04,631
Of course this is what we should explain in a formula.

14
00:01:05,829 --> 00:01:08,915
So lets look at "f star g" at a given point x.

15
00:01:09,929 --> 00:01:17,994
Then we define this value by an integral that goes through all numbers. So we start with - infinity and go to infinity.

16
00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:24,288
Of course inside we have the functions f and g and the variable name for the integration.

17
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,685
and for this i want to use the greek letter Tau.

18
00:01:29,514 --> 00:01:33,912
This is very common, because in some sense the variable can stand for time.

19
00:01:34,957 --> 00:01:39,216
So here you see we have the first function f at the point Tau 

20
00:01:39,416 --> 00:01:42,662
Times the function g at another point.

21
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:50,112
and now i already told you g should go the other direction so what we need inside is (-Tau).

22
00:01:51,343 --> 00:01:55,654
Moreover we also shift the point here by our given point x.

23
00:01:56,643 --> 00:02:01,182
and that's what we have. This product of the two functions is integrated.

24
00:02:01,914 --> 00:02:07,362
and if this integral exists for all points x in R we have the convolution.

25
00:02:08,457 --> 00:02:14,945
Indeed this convolution has some nice properties and therefore it is very important in a lot of applications.

26
00:02:15,814 --> 00:02:19,529
For this reason i hope that you now can remember the definition.

27
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:23,722
Then have a nice day and see you next time. Bye!

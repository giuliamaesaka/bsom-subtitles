Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:02,443 --> 00:00:05,686
and the mathematical symbol of today is given by the quaternions.

3
00:00:05,986 --> 00:00:07,724
Denoted with such an H.

4
00:00:08,771 --> 00:00:14,900
Seeing that double line here, you might already guess that this symbol stands for a special set.

5
00:00:15,643 --> 00:00:20,743
and indeed it's a number set that extends the complex numbers C.

6
00:00:21,329 --> 00:00:28,914
It's an extension in the sense that it's a bigger number set, with almost the same rules as we have it in the complex numbers.

7
00:00:29,786 --> 00:00:36,920
In fact in H we lose one important calculation rule, namely that the multiplication is commutative.

8
00:00:37,757 --> 00:00:42,614
This means that if you multiply numbers in H the order matters now.

9
00:00:43,586 --> 00:00:49,076
However if you want to multiply numbers you need to know about which numbers we talk.

10
00:00:49,914 --> 00:00:54,067
and i can tell you a quaternion consists of 4 parts.

11
00:00:54,814 --> 00:00:57,851
So maybe lets call them a, b, c and d.

12
00:00:58,329 --> 00:01:00,923
and these are ordinary real numbers.

13
00:01:02,029 --> 00:01:07,238
Now as you might know it from the complex numbers, we can connect these parts with +

14
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:10,429
and then introduce a new strange number "i".

15
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,874
This means that we have that i^2 is -1.

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,301
However now you can see we have 2 parts left.

17
00:01:20,757 --> 00:01:25,596
Therefore we need to introduce two new numbers we can call j and k.

18
00:01:26,271 --> 00:01:31,243
and indeed j^2 and k^2 should also be -1.

19
00:01:32,371 --> 00:01:37,414
Moreover we also have the property that if we multiply all 3 together,

20
00:01:37,814 --> 00:01:39,788
So first "i", then j, then k.

21
00:01:40,429 --> 00:01:42,154
We also get out -1.

22
00:01:43,171 --> 00:01:48,186
Ok and there you have all the rules we need to calculate with quaternions.

23
00:01:48,986 --> 00:01:53,121
Indeed this construction here is what we would call a quaternion.

24
00:01:54,129 --> 00:01:59,226
Now using these rules and some other basic assumptions, like associativity

25
00:01:59,426 --> 00:02:03,361
we can show that the multiplication is in fact not commutative.

26
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:10,456
For example we get that "i" multiplied with j is - the other order.

27
00:02:11,043 --> 00:02:13,903
So j multiplied with "i".

28
00:02:14,729 --> 00:02:21,861
Indeed if you combine "i" with k or j with k, you will get the same relation here with the - sign.

29
00:02:22,743 --> 00:02:27,997
So in general you can remember, if you multiply quaternions the order matters.

30
00:02:28,829 --> 00:02:37,658
and now to close this video i can tell you, the letter H for the number set is chosen to honor the mathematician William Rowan Hamilton.

31
00:02:38,629 --> 00:02:42,514
So i hope that this was helpful and that i see you next time.

32
00:02:42,614 --> 00:02:43,329
Bye!

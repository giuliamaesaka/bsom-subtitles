The mathematical symbol of today is this small circle, we use for the composition of maps or functions.

2
00:00:08,371 --> 00:00:15,378
It's a binary operation, where we have one map "f" on the right hand side and another map "g" on the left hand side.

3
00:00:15,886 --> 00:00:21,648
Indeed the composition is very basic, but it's an important notion throughout mathematics.

4
00:00:22,271 --> 00:00:25,275
It simply merges two maps into a new one. 

5
00:00:25,943 --> 00:00:30,640
and the definition can simply be given when we put in an element "x".

6
00:00:31,443 --> 00:00:35,829
First f is applied to x and then g is applied on this output.

7
00:00:36,686 --> 00:00:39,908
In other words we put f(x) into g.

8
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,914
So we have g(f(x)).

9
00:00:43,929 --> 00:00:50,886
Now to remember this order, it's always good to have a visualization of the sets, where the maps act on, in mind.

10
00:00:51,829 --> 00:00:55,382
First we have f that maps from left to the middle.

11
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:59,813
and then we have g that maps from the middle set to the right set.

12
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:06,486
Therefore the new map g composed with f goes immediately from left to right.

13
00:01:07,014 --> 00:01:09,929
Ok and that explains the composition symbol.

14
00:01:10,531 --> 00:01:14,844
If you want to know more i have a whole video about the composition of maps.

15
00:01:15,229 --> 00:01:18,084
and with this i hope i see you in the next video.

16
00:01:18,284 --> 00:01:19,273
Bye!

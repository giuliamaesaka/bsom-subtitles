00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:04,821
The mathematical symbol of today is the landau symbol big O.

2
00:00:05,771 --> 00:00:11,496
For this notation you either see a normal capital O or the slightly open O.

3
00:00:12,357 --> 00:00:17,429
In either case you always find next to it parentheses with a function.

4
00:00:18,286 --> 00:00:24,900
So there is a function named for example g and you also often find the variable name, for example x.

5
00:00:26,157 --> 00:00:31,714
Now it is important to note that this big O only makes sense with respect to a limit.

6
00:00:32,857 --> 00:00:37,476
For example you can write at the end, that the variable x goes to the number "a".

7
00:00:38,543 --> 00:00:44,131
Also it's allowed that this "a" is the symbol infinity or the symbol - infinity.

8
00:00:45,229 --> 00:00:50,584
Now usually in this big O notation we use an equality sign in a symbolic way.

9
00:00:51,429 --> 00:00:58,384
So you would write another function f(x) is equal to this big O of g(x).

10
00:00:59,286 --> 00:01:02,689
We do this to make calculations easier to write down.

11
00:01:03,571 --> 00:01:07,865
However the formal correct way would be to use an element sign here.

12
00:01:08,771 --> 00:01:14,450
Having said that of course the most important part is that you know the meaning of this expression here.

13
00:01:15,229 --> 00:01:23,614
Indeed it simply means that the function f on the left hand side does not grow stronger than the function g on the right hand side

14
00:01:23,671 --> 00:01:25,629
when x goes to the number "a".

15
00:01:26,757 --> 00:01:32,838
Hence usually this is helpful when you are not able to put in "a" into the 2 functions.

16
00:01:33,686 --> 00:01:38,042
For example we always have this case when "a" is the symbol infinity.

17
00:01:39,214 --> 00:01:43,871
Now of course this explanation that f does not grow stronger than g

18
00:01:43,957 --> 00:01:47,648
can be put into a formula, where we use absolute values.

19
00:01:48,814 --> 00:01:59,659
So you would say the absolute value of f(x) ia always less or equal than a fixed constant M times the absolute value of g(x).

20
00:02:01,014 --> 00:02:06,444
and indeed this should hold for all points x in the neighbourhood around "a".

21
00:02:07,357 --> 00:02:16,207
In the case that "a" is infinity this means that we have a bound such that all points x above this bound satisfy this inequality.

22
00:02:17,414 --> 00:02:23,396
Now if you don't like this constant M, we can also rewrite the whole thing with a limit superior.

23
00:02:24,443 --> 00:02:28,343
So we have lim sup where x goes to the point "a".

24
00:02:29,086 --> 00:02:33,203
and then we take the absolute value of f divided by g.

25
00:02:34,486 --> 00:02:39,566
and now this lim sup should be a finite number so we can write less than infinity.

26
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:46,614
So you see it means the same thing, we compare the growth rate of f with the growth rate of g.

27
00:02:47,471 --> 00:02:52,614
and in a case that f would grow faster, then this whole thing here would go to infinity.

28
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:57,835
So maybe it's even better for the explanation when we look at an example.

29
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,438
So lets say we have the polynomial x^2 + x + 2.

30
00:03:04,371 --> 00:03:11,291
Then we can say this is in big O of x^2, if x goes to infinity.

31
00:03:12,414 --> 00:03:19,123
However now you know we can also say that the same polynomial is in big O of x^3.

32
00:03:20,086 --> 00:03:24,548
Of course also in the case when we look what happens when x goes to infinity.

33
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:30,316
Indeed this is what you can check now. x^3 grows faster than x^2.

34
00:03:31,386 --> 00:03:35,867
However because we only have an inequality here both things are correct.

35
00:03:36,786 --> 00:03:39,376
Ok i think that's good enough for today.

36
00:03:40,043 --> 00:03:44,940
Now i really hope that you learned something today and that i can see you in the next video.

37
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:45,886
Bye!

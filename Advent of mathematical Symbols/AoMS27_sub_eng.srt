Hello and welcome back to the next mathematical symbol.

2
00:00:03,872 --> 00:00:05,840
Which is the subset symbol.

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:11,043
For denoting such a subset relation you either see this symbol or that.

4
00:00:11,386 --> 00:00:19,822
Personally I prefer this notation, because the line here immediately tells you that the equality of sets is also allowed here.

5
00:00:20,414 --> 00:00:25,040
However some authors take this simple arc here. Maybe because it's shorter.

6
00:00:25,414 --> 00:00:30,375
Therefore please always pay attention to which symbol is used in a given book.

7
00:00:30,886 --> 00:00:36,776
It's very important, because often there is also a notation which is used to denote a proper subset.

8
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:41,490
This means there the equality is actually not allowed.

9
00:00:41,843 --> 00:00:47,272
Hence if we use the first notation here, we can do the same if we denote inequalities.

10
00:00:47,886 --> 00:00:52,891
So you see, if we want to denote a proper subset, we can just omit the line here.

11
00:00:53,343 --> 00:00:58,999
So unfortunately this is the same symbol some people use to denote a general subset.

12
00:00:59,429 --> 00:01:05,141
However this also means that these people need another notation for a proper subset

13
00:01:05,341 --> 00:01:10,151
and usually they use the first symbol, where they just cross the line underneath.

14
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:16,976
Ok, so in summary what you should remember is that the symbols here come always in these two combinations

15
00:01:17,343 --> 00:01:21,773
and they just tell you that one set is contained in another.

16
00:01:22,214 --> 00:01:27,271
So if this here is the set B, the set A should lie completely inside

17
00:01:27,657 --> 00:01:31,911
and then we would just write: "A is a subset of B"

18
00:01:32,414 --> 00:01:36,713
and indeed most of the time we will not exclude the equality here

19
00:01:37,343 --> 00:01:42,982
and now this symbol just means that for all x the following implication is true.

20
00:01:43,182 --> 00:01:47,143
So if x is an element in A, it's also an element in B.

21
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:52,572
So you see, this new definition just goes back to the element relation

22
00:01:52,772 --> 00:01:59,861
and now since we have the implication from left to right, you also often see a mirrored version of this symbol.

23
00:02:00,343 --> 00:02:04,341
More precisely you would say: "B is a superset of A"

24
00:02:04,743 --> 00:02:08,687
and then of course this means exactly the same thing written here.

25
00:02:08,887 --> 00:02:13,995
So I would say now you know the subset symbol and also the superset symbol

26
00:02:14,195 --> 00:02:20,959
and if you want to learn more details about sets, I have a whole video series about it called "start learning sets".

27
00:02:21,243 --> 00:02:25,764
So I really hope I see you there or in the next video about mathematical symbols.

28
00:02:26,029 --> 00:02:28,552
So have a nice day and bye.

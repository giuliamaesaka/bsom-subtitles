Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:02,372 --> 00:00:05,314
The mathematical symbol of today is little o.

3
00:00:05,543 --> 00:00:07,519
Denoted with a small o.

4
00:00:08,514 --> 00:00:14,801
If you know the big O notation, you will not be surprised that we also find parantheses next to the little o.

5
00:00:15,001 --> 00:00:17,329
and also a function inside.

6
00:00:17,796 --> 00:00:20,879
So this is little o of g(x).

7
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,414
However this symbol only makes sense with respect to a limit.

8
00:00:25,786 --> 00:00:29,119
So we would write x goes to a number "a".

9
00:00:29,857 --> 00:00:35,429
In fact "a" could be a real number or the symbol infinity or - infinity.

10
00:00:36,214 --> 00:00:41,898
Now in this little o notation we usually use an equality sign in a symbolic way.

11
00:00:42,743 --> 00:00:48,555
So we would say another function f(x) is equal to little o of g(x).

12
00:00:49,357 --> 00:00:55,332
However as for the big O notation an element relation here would be the formal correct way.

13
00:00:56,029 --> 00:00:58,785
Nevertheless of course this is not so important.

14
00:00:58,814 --> 00:01:02,343
The important thing is that you know the meaning of this expression here.

15
00:01:03,343 --> 00:01:12,186
In fact this little o here should tell you that the function g grows much faster than the function f, when x goes to "a".

16
00:01:13,271 --> 00:01:17,343
and this property can be expressed with a limit process.

17
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:20,342
So we have limit x goes to "a".

18
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:25,252
and then we simply consider the ratio of f to g.

19
00:01:26,171 --> 00:01:31,742
Now usually for consistency reasons one takes the absolute value of this ratio.

20
00:01:32,871 --> 00:01:36,613
and then finally in the limit this should go to 0.

21
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:44,843
So you see this equality tells us that the function g dominates the function f in this limit process.

22
00:01:45,929 --> 00:01:49,310
Ok, then i think it's helpful to look at an example here.

23
00:01:50,457 --> 00:01:53,686
Here lets consider the function 8 times x squared.

24
00:01:54,929 --> 00:01:59,090
and the limit process we are interested in should be x goes to infinity.

25
00:02:00,214 --> 00:02:03,958
and now the function g should be just x squared.

26
00:02:04,786 --> 00:02:09,967
So here you should see we do not have that the limit on the left hand side goes to 0. 

27
00:02:10,929 --> 00:02:16,022
So this function is not of little o(x^2), when x goes to infinity.

28
00:02:16,943 --> 00:02:22,654
However if we consider little o of x cubed, we have that the limit goes to 0.

29
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:28,652
So we can say this function 8 times x^2 is little o(x^3).

30
00:02:29,743 --> 00:02:34,360
Ok, then i hope that this was helpful and that i can see you in the next video.

31
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,193
Bye!

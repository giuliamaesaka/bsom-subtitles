Hello and welcome back to the next mathematical symbol.

2
00:00:03,857 --> 00:00:06,431
Which is today the element symbol.

3
00:00:06,971 --> 00:00:11,793
This is exactly written like this. So you take a lower case c with a line inside it

4
00:00:12,414 --> 00:00:18,131
and then you use it as a binary operator, where we have a left-hand side and the right-hand side.

5
00:00:18,786 --> 00:00:24,982
On the right-hand side you find a given set and on the left-hand side an element of this set.

6
00:00:25,182 --> 00:00:29,790
So you would read it like: " a is in A"

7
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,398
and now you remember, this is the sole operation we need to describe sets.

8
00:00:36,014 --> 00:00:41,750
Hence the visualization would be that the set A is such a collection of elements.

9
00:00:42,457 --> 00:00:49,262
This means if "a in A" is a true statement, we would draw the lower case a inside the capital A.

10
00:00:49,743 --> 00:00:56,787
However it's also possible that the set A is also an element in another larger set.

11
00:00:57,457 --> 00:01:03,113
So we could write capital A is an element of a larger set curved A.

12
00:01:03,829 --> 00:01:08,550
Hence for this it would mean, the visualization is exactly the same.

13
00:01:08,914 --> 00:01:13,363
So capital A can be seen as a point in this curved A.

14
00:01:13,563 --> 00:01:18,121
So we learn, such an object can be an element, but also a set.

15
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,249
So it can be on the right-hand side, but also on the left-hand side.

16
00:01:21,449 --> 00:01:28,297
So in the visualization it would mean, if you zoom in, you see that this element has also elements for itself.

17
00:01:29,286 --> 00:01:36,060
So there we have it. This is the element symbol we use throughout mathematics to describe the element-set relation

18
00:01:36,457 --> 00:01:42,993
and if you want to learn more about this I have a whole video course about this called "start learning sets".

19
00:01:43,193 --> 00:01:47,977
So let's meet there or on the next day for the next mathematical symbol.

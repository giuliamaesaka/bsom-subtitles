Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:06,300
The mathematical symbol of today is given by the outer product for vectors.

3
00:00:06,371 --> 00:00:09,226
Which is given by this product sign here.

4
00:00:09,943 --> 00:00:14,059
So you see it's a common multiplication sign with a circle around it.

5
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:20,643
Now since this is such a nice symbol it's also often used to denote other mathamtical objects.

6
00:00:21,471 --> 00:00:25,845
However the outer product for vectors might be the simplest one of these.

7
00:00:26,543 --> 00:00:31,814
Indeed this outer product here is related to the kronecker product for matrices.

8
00:00:31,871 --> 00:00:34,125
Which is also denoted with this symbol.

9
00:00:35,143 --> 00:00:40,536
Therefore some people say the outer product is just a kronecker product, but for vectors.

10
00:00:41,229 --> 00:00:44,329
So maybe i can immediately explain it.

11
00:00:44,486 --> 00:00:47,356
We have one vector on the left hand side of the sign

12
00:00:47,357 --> 00:00:48,798
and one on the right hand side.

13
00:00:49,686 --> 00:00:51,889
Indeed the dimensions could be different.

14
00:00:52,089 --> 00:00:56,592
So we have the 2-dimensional vector here and maybe a 3-dimensional vector on the right hand side.

15
00:00:57,586 --> 00:01:01,733
In other words we have a vector v times a vector w.

16
00:01:02,814 --> 00:01:06,005
and now what should come out is a matrix.

17
00:01:06,829 --> 00:01:12,471
Indeed the height of the matrix is given by the vector v and the width is given by the vector w.

18
00:01:13,614 --> 00:01:17,206
Now the entries of the matrix are not so hard to remember,

19
00:01:17,406 --> 00:01:22,303
because in each column of the matrix we first find a copy of the vector v.

20
00:01:22,986 --> 00:01:29,197
Of course the vector w comes also in, but now we find a copy of it in each row.

21
00:01:30,314 --> 00:01:33,356
This means that you first have to transpose the vector.

22
00:01:33,557 --> 00:01:35,700
and then you can push it to the row.

23
00:01:36,643 --> 00:01:39,300
and in the same way we have it for the second row.

24
00:01:40,629 --> 00:01:47,073
Ok and now you see in each entry of the matrix we just have the product for ordinary numbers.

25
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:53,573
In fact this is already the whole construction for the kronecker product with two vectors. 

26
00:01:54,371 --> 00:01:59,771
and of course it's not hard at all to generalize this to other dimensions than 2 and 3.

27
00:02:00,786 --> 00:02:04,471
You just have to remember how the matrix entries are formed.

28
00:02:05,386 --> 00:02:09,043
So v times w gives us always a matrix.

29
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:15,051
and now we can just look at a general entry with indices "i" and j.

30
00:02:15,729 --> 00:02:23,139
and as you have learned before this one is simply given by v_i times w_j.

31
00:02:23,943 --> 00:02:28,428
So you see we can use this for the definition of the outer product.

32
00:02:29,171 --> 00:02:32,176
and with this i hope you have learned something today.

33
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,515
Then see you next time.

34
00:02:34,715 --> 00:02:35,686
Bye!

00:00:00,671 --> 00:00:04,309
The mathematical symbol of today is the so called beta function.

2
00:00:04,509 --> 00:00:07,013
Which is denoted with the greek letter beta.

3
00:00:07,771 --> 00:00:11,933
However you see it's the capital letter, which looks like a normal B.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,629
Now the beta function has two variables as its input.

5
00:00:16,686 --> 00:00:18,875
So lets call them x and y.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,503
Indeed x and y could be complex numbers.

7
00:00:24,557 --> 00:00:28,749
However then the real part of both numbers should be positive.

8
00:00:29,757 --> 00:00:35,182
So we write: real part of x greater than 0 and real part of y greater than 0.

9
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:40,957
Ok by knowing this we now can write down the definition of the beta function.

10
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:46,442
and indeed it's given by an integral from 0 to 1.

11
00:00:47,314 --> 00:00:50,514
and the variable we integrate over we call t.

12
00:00:51,314 --> 00:00:55,271
Now the first t here has a power, where x occurs.

13
00:00:56,171 --> 00:00:59,190
Indeed the exponent is (x - 1).

14
00:01:00,071 --> 00:01:04,886
and then comes the factor (1 - t), where in the power we find y.

15
00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:08,711
More precisely it's (y - 1).

16
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:13,038
Ok so this is the whole definition of the beta function.

17
00:01:13,986 --> 00:01:18,921
and when you already know the gamma function i can tell you an important identity.

18
00:01:19,729 --> 00:01:24,552
Indeed the beta function and the gamma function are closely connected.

19
00:01:25,343 --> 00:01:38,799
More concretely B(x, y) can be writen as "gamma(x) times gamma(y) divided by gamma(x + y)."

20
00:01:39,943 --> 00:01:46,902
This can be proven when you use the integral definition of the beta function and the integral definition of the gamma function.

21
00:01:48,014 --> 00:01:56,518
and now i can also tell you, because the gamma function is related to the factorial, the beta function is related to the binomial coefficient.

22
00:01:57,529 --> 00:02:00,295
However that can be a whole topic for another video.

23
00:02:01,257 --> 00:02:05,875
Here you have seen the definition of the beta function and i hope that this was helpful.

24
00:02:06,671 --> 00:02:08,799
In this case i see you next time.

25
00:02:08,999 --> 00:02:09,629
Bye!

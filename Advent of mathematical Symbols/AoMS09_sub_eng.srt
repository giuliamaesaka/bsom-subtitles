The mathematical symbol of today is the restriction for maps.

2
00:00:04,871 --> 00:00:07,014
Denoted with such a vertical line.

3
00:00:07,743 --> 00:00:11,729
and usually on the left hand side you find a map f

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,478
and at the index you find a set A.

5
00:00:15,514 --> 00:00:20,900
Now since on the fundamental level in mathematics we often deal with maps and sets

6
00:00:21,229 --> 00:00:24,545
this restriction operator occurs very often.

7
00:00:25,414 --> 00:00:30,504
Indeed this whole thing here just denotes a new map, when we already have a map f.

8
00:00:31,129 --> 00:00:36,296
More precisely you would start with a map f, defined on a set X.

9
00:00:37,343 --> 00:00:40,892
and the codomain we call Y. So we map into Y.

10
00:00:41,943 --> 00:00:44,012
However now we want to change the domain.

11
00:00:44,212 --> 00:00:46,782
So we look at a subset A of X.

12
00:00:47,629 --> 00:00:54,104
This means now, that this f restricted to A should be a map that is only defined on the set A.

13
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,107
So the domain is A, but we still map into Y.

14
00:00:59,029 --> 00:01:06,941
and now the only question we have is: how can we define this new map, we could call the restriction of f to A.

15
00:01:07,657 --> 00:01:12,934
Indeed the definition is very simple, because it should do the same as f itself.

16
00:01:13,986 --> 00:01:19,805
This means if we put in an x, we get the same result no matter which function we use.

17
00:01:20,614 --> 00:01:27,943
However you should note here for our new map, we are only allowed to use points x that come from the set A.

18
00:01:28,757 --> 00:01:34,521
So you see the reason for introducing this new map is not for calculating the values.

19
00:01:35,371 --> 00:01:41,902
Rather we use it if we want to work with the map as an object, but now defined on a smaller set.

20
00:01:42,571 --> 00:01:47,098
Therefore you see this symbol very often, when you learn mathematics.

21
00:01:47,843 --> 00:01:52,429
So i hope that this was helpful and that i see you in the next video.

22
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:53,114
Bye!

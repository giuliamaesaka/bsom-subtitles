Hello and welcome 

2
00:00:02,249 --> 00:00:05,704
The mathematical symbol of today is simply an arrow.

3
00:00:06,243 --> 00:00:09,099
More precisely i want to talk about two arrows.

4
00:00:09,114 --> 00:00:11,049
This one and that one.

5
00:00:11,957 --> 00:00:15,657
In mathematics both arrows are used when we talk about maps.

6
00:00:15,786 --> 00:00:18,071
For example lets consider a map f.

7
00:00:19,143 --> 00:00:24,611
Then the first arrow is used, when we want talk about the sets, where the map lives on.

8
00:00:25,086 --> 00:00:29,340
So we have a set X on the left hand side, which we call the domain of f.

9
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:33,470
and a set Y on the right hand side, which we call the codomain of f.

10
00:00:34,386 --> 00:00:38,928
In other words f maps elements from X into the set Y.

11
00:00:39,814 --> 00:00:44,820
and in order to describe this mapping on the element level, we use the second arrow.

12
00:00:45,714 --> 00:00:48,789
Hence an element on the left hand side, lower case x

13
00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:53,122
is mapped to an element on the right hand side in Y, we call f(x).

14
00:00:54,014 --> 00:00:56,502
In fact this is all you should learn here.

15
00:00:56,702 --> 00:01:00,193
We have two different arrows for the two different levels.

16
00:01:00,929 --> 00:01:02,902
Now maybe lets do a simple example.

17
00:01:03,102 --> 00:01:07,171
So we consider the quadratic function defined on the real number line.

18
00:01:08,186 --> 00:01:13,214
Hence you would use the first arrow to denote that R is mapped into R.

19
00:01:13,957 --> 00:01:19,542
and then you see, we use the second arrow to denote that x is mapped to x squared.

20
00:01:20,529 --> 00:01:24,487
In summary with this the whole function is described.

21
00:01:25,057 --> 00:01:28,216
In the first line we have the domain and the codomain.

22
00:01:28,416 --> 00:01:31,621
and in the second line we see how this assignment should work.

23
00:01:32,457 --> 00:01:36,868
Now if you want to learn more about maps. I have a lot of videos about them.

24
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:41,323
and with this, i hope i see you next time. Bye!

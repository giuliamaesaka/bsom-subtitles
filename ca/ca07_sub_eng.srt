Hello and welcome back to complex analysis.

2
00:00:04,586 --> 00:00:10,827
and first i want to thank all the very nice people that support this channel on Steady, via Paypal or by other means.

3
00:00:11,743 --> 00:00:17,131
Now, in todays part 7 i show you examples for the famous Cauchy-Riemann equations.

4
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:22,444
For this lets first recall the important theorem from the last video.

5
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,554
There we introduced the Cauchy-Riemann equations with respect to the complex differentiability.

6
00:00:29,343 --> 00:00:33,884
Hence we can immediately reformulate the theorem for holomorphic functions.

7
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:39,798
and as always for this we have to choose an open subset capital U in C.

8
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:47,649
and now you should already know the complex function can be equivalently described as a function from R^2 into R^2.

9
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:54,424
However in this case for the new function the domain should also be an open subset of R^2.

10
00:00:55,014 --> 00:00:57,625
So maybe lets simply call it U_R.

11
00:00:58,686 --> 00:01:04,217
Obviously when you visualize U and U_R in the plane, they look exactly the same.

12
00:01:04,971 --> 00:01:09,476
In other words the open domain here does not make any problems at all.

13
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:17,689
Ok, now in the last video we have learned that we can split up the function f into a real and an imaginary part.

14
00:01:18,343 --> 00:01:24,493
and both we can see as a function from U_R as a subset of R^2 into R.

15
00:01:24,886 --> 00:01:29,903
In particular the real part function here, we denote by a lower case u.

16
00:01:30,414 --> 00:01:34,057
So please recall this u is a real valued function.

17
00:01:34,971 --> 00:01:41,053
and then exactly in the same way, the imaginary part of f gives us a function we call v.

18
00:01:41,414 --> 00:01:46,513
So also here we have a function with domain U_R and codomain R.

19
00:01:47,443 --> 00:01:53,299
Hence you see, the whole information of the function f is now translated into these 2 functions.

20
00:01:54,071 --> 00:02:02,086
Indeed the property that f is holomorphic translates into the fact that u and v fulfil the Cauchy-Riemann equations.

21
00:02:03,014 --> 00:02:07,826
These are not complicated at all. There are just 2 partial differential equations.

22
00:02:08,557 --> 00:02:17,597
The first one simply says that the partial derivative of u with respect to x is the same as the partial derivative of v with respect to y.

23
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:23,286
and then in the second equation you see, when you switch the roles there is a minus sign included.

24
00:02:24,386 --> 00:02:32,388
In summary what we need for a holomorphic function is that these 2 equations are fulfilled at each point in the set U_R.

25
00:02:33,457 --> 00:02:37,523
In fact this equivalence here, we have discussed in the last video.

26
00:02:38,043 --> 00:02:41,611
Now in this video i want to show you concrete examples.

27
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,033
and i would say, lets immediately start with a very simple one.

28
00:02:46,986 --> 00:02:53,767
So lets take the complex function f from C to C. Given as the identity.

29
00:02:54,671 --> 00:02:57,951
Which means the number z is simply mapped to z again.

30
00:02:59,014 --> 00:03:06,656
Now, because we want to deal with the partial derivatives with respect to x and y, we have to write z as (x + iy).

31
00:03:07,786 --> 00:03:11,431
Hence we do this change on the left hand side and on the right hand side.

32
00:03:12,314 --> 00:03:19,045
and then you see, here the real part is our function u and the imaginary part is our function v.

33
00:03:19,929 --> 00:03:23,830
So you see in this case it's not complicated at all.

34
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:28,929
and now we just want to check if the Cauchy-Riemann equations are satisfied.

35
00:03:29,957 --> 00:03:32,489
So lets write down the partial derivatives.

36
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:37,928
First we have du/dx. Which is in this case simply 1.

37
00:03:38,729 --> 00:03:47,597
In the same way we also see that dv/dy is very easy to calculate, because this is a simple function and the derivative is just 1 again.

38
00:03:48,771 --> 00:03:53,901
Hence we immediately see that the first equation is satisfied at all points.

39
00:03:54,271 --> 00:03:58,434
So lets go to the second equation, where we have du/dy.

40
00:03:59,514 --> 00:04:03,578
There we see, there is no y in u. Therefore we get 0.

41
00:04:04,271 --> 00:04:08,837
In fact the same holds for dv/dx, because there is no x in v.

42
00:04:09,371 --> 00:04:12,459
and also of course, the minus sign does not change anything.

43
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,681
In summary, both Cauchy-Riemann equations are fulfilled.

44
00:04:18,486 --> 00:04:22,290
From that we then can conclude that the function f is holomorphic.

45
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:26,046
Of course this is a fact we have already known.

46
00:04:26,857 --> 00:04:33,745
Therefore i would say in the next example, lets look at a function where we already know that it is not holomorphic.

47
00:04:34,571 --> 00:04:37,996
Indeed this was simply the complex conjugation.

48
00:04:38,814 --> 00:04:40,470
So f(z) is z bar.

49
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:47,868
Now as before, in order to apply the Cauchy-Riemann equations we have to rewrite that with x and y.

50
00:04:48,586 --> 00:04:53,698
Of course this is not so complicated. The imaginary part just gets a minus sign.

51
00:04:54,743 --> 00:04:59,862
and then as before, the real part is u and the imaginary part here is v.

52
00:05:00,471 --> 00:05:05,664
So you see it's different from before and it will change the Cauchy-Riemann equation.

53
00:05:06,771 --> 00:05:13,054
Of course here du/dx is still 1, but dv/dy is now -1.

54
00:05:13,914 --> 00:05:17,401
Therefore we can conclude: this is not the same.

55
00:05:18,057 --> 00:05:20,301
Indeed no matter which point we put in.

56
00:05:21,043 --> 00:05:26,498
In conclusion we get the result, we've expected. Namely f is not holomorphic.

57
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:33,013
Here you see, showing this was very simple by just using the Cauchy-Riemann equations.

58
00:05:33,943 --> 00:05:38,022
However maybe we should also look at a more complicated example.

59
00:05:39,014 --> 00:05:42,099
So lets take another complex function f.

60
00:05:42,814 --> 00:05:47,326
and now i want to look at it as z^2 + iz.

61
00:05:47,871 --> 00:05:54,400
To be honest. You already know that this is a holomorphic function, because it is a complex polynomial.

62
00:05:55,200 --> 00:06:01,485
Indeed we already know how to calcualte the complex derivative for such a complex polynomial.

63
00:06:02,257 --> 00:06:05,101
Here it should be 2 times z + i.

64
00:06:05,543 --> 00:06:09,531
Still it's helpful to check it with the Cauchy-Riemann equations.

65
00:06:10,586 --> 00:06:16,479
Now, by writing x + iy instead of z, we actually have something to do now,

66
00:06:17,057 --> 00:06:23,119
because in this expression here, we don't see immediately the real and imaginary part.

67
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,876
We first have to calculate a little bit.

68
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:32,139
However that's not so complicated, we simply can do the whole calculation here.

69
00:06:32,614 --> 00:06:42,871
So we have x^2 + i2xy - y^2 from the binomial + ix and -y.

70
00:06:43,729 --> 00:06:48,299
Now lets put the real part to the left and the imaginary part to the right.

71
00:06:49,014 --> 00:06:55,322
So the real part is everything without an "i" and for the imaginary part i factor out one "i".

72
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:59,190
and then we have the result we wanted,

73
00:07:00,057 --> 00:07:05,038
because again, here we have our function u and there we have the function v.

74
00:07:05,986 --> 00:07:10,214
Now with these 2 functions we can check the Cauchy-Riemann equations again.

75
00:07:11,386 --> 00:07:15,814
First du/dx, not hard to see, is simply 2 times x

76
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:23,738
Then the second partial derivative we want to calculate is dv/dy, which is also 2x.

77
00:07:24,857 --> 00:07:28,398
Hence our first equation is actually fulfilled.

78
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:37,122
Going to the second one, you see we have to do a little bit more, because this derivative is -2y - 1

79
00:07:37,714 --> 00:07:44,592
Ok, then the last derivative we want to calculate would be the partial derivative of v with respect to x.

80
00:07:45,457 --> 00:07:48,741
and there you see, it's 2y + 1

81
00:07:49,543 --> 00:07:53,746
and then for our equation we just have to put a minus in front.

82
00:07:54,229 --> 00:07:58,317
and then we recognize this is the same as du/dy.

83
00:07:59,071 --> 00:08:04,858
Therefore also here both equations are fulfilled. So the function f is holomorphic.

84
00:08:05,514 --> 00:08:08,421
I already told you, this is not a surprise for us.

85
00:08:09,429 --> 00:08:14,871
However with this example you have learned how you can apply the Cauchy-Riemann equations,

86
00:08:14,914 --> 00:08:18,857
when the function f is given as a real and an imaginary part.

87
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:25,952
and in fact you also get the complex derivative of f from these partial derivatives here,

88
00:08:26,757 --> 00:08:30,069
but i think this is a good topic for the next video.

89
00:08:30,757 --> 00:08:36,457
Therefore i really hope that i see you there. Have a nice day and bye!

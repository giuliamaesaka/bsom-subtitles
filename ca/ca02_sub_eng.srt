00:00:00,571 --> 00:00:03,935
Hello and welcome back to complex analysis.

2
00:00:04,729 --> 00:00:11,186
and first i want to thank all the nice people that support this channel on Steady, via Paypal or by other means.

3
00:00:12,029 --> 00:00:19,157
Now, in today's part 2 we will talk about the complex differentiability of functions from C to C.

4
00:00:19,986 --> 00:00:26,007
This means that the input and the output of the function f is given by complex numbers.

5
00:00:26,957 --> 00:00:32,900
Now you might recall from real analysis, that first differentiability is a local property.

6
00:00:33,929 --> 00:00:39,871
This means when we ask the question, if the function f is differentiable at a given point z_0

7
00:00:39,986 --> 00:00:43,608
it only matters what happens around this point z_0.

8
00:00:44,186 --> 00:00:50,013
and for that reason the domain of the function f does not have to be the whole complex plane.

9
00:00:50,586 --> 00:00:54,622
It can be any open set U in the complex plane.

10
00:00:55,386 --> 00:01:01,100
Hence if you visualize the complex plane like this, you can just mark any region here.

11
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:06,938
For example our domain U for the function f could be this set here.

12
00:01:07,614 --> 00:01:13,350
It could look as strange as you want. The only important thing we need is that it's an open set.

13
00:01:14,271 --> 00:01:20,095
Now of course the natural question now should be: what is an open set for the complex numbers.

14
00:01:21,229 --> 00:01:27,514
Hence this is the first thing we now want to define before we talk about the definition of differentiability.

15
00:01:28,343 --> 00:01:32,921
Now I can tell you this definition is the same for all metric spaces.

16
00:01:33,121 --> 00:01:37,741
and please recall a metric space is a set, where you can measure distances.

17
00:01:38,571 --> 00:01:45,183
In C, the complex numbers, we can do this and of course we can also do this in R, the real numbers.

18
00:01:45,771 --> 00:01:51,324
Therefore this definition is exactly the same as I showed you in my real analysis course.

19
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:58,160
Nevertheless it's good to refresh your memory because this notion is used throughout this course.

20
00:01:59,129 --> 00:02:02,333
Indeed openness is not complicated at all.

21
00:02:02,486 --> 00:02:06,222
and to get an idea let's take our set U from before.

22
00:02:06,771 --> 00:02:15,680
Visually speaking this set should be an open set if these boundary points you can see here are not part of the set U itself.

23
00:02:16,343 --> 00:02:25,245
In other words if you are a point in the set, then around you, you only see points of the set U.

24
00:02:26,014 --> 00:02:31,913
To put it more precisely; a whole epsilon-ball around z lies in the set U.

25
00:02:32,571 --> 00:02:37,505
and if this works for every point from the set U, we call U open.

26
00:02:38,257 --> 00:02:42,796
So formally we would write: for all z in U,

27
00:02:43,471 --> 00:02:46,324
there exists an epsilon-ball

28
00:02:46,929 --> 00:02:52,956
and here you already know from the last video, the epsilon-ball is denoted by B_epsilon(z).

29
00:02:53,929 --> 00:02:59,529
and now our claim here is, this epsilon-ball lies completely inside the set U.

30
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:05,244
Ok, so this is openness for subsets of the complex numbers.

31
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:10,124
One important example is of course the complex plane itself.

32
00:03:10,943 --> 00:03:16,627
Also it's easy to show, that every epsilon-ball is open with this definition.

33
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:22,236
Ok, other useful and important examples we will see later.

34
00:03:22,971 --> 00:03:27,416
Here first as promised we want to talk about differentiability.

35
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,003
However now the function f we consider has a domain we call U.

36
00:03:33,829 --> 00:03:38,679
So it's still a complex function, but now with a general open domain U.

37
00:03:39,914 --> 00:03:46,886
and now to write down the definition of differentiable at a given point, we have to fix this given point.

38
00:03:47,571 --> 00:03:51,211
So we have z_0 as a point in U.

39
00:03:51,957 --> 00:03:58,658
Hence, then we are able to define what it means that the function f is differentiable at z_0.

40
00:03:59,529 --> 00:04:07,398
and often to make it clear that we are talking about complex functions here, we say that the function is complex differentiable at the point.

41
00:04:08,386 --> 00:04:12,643
However the meaning is exactly the same as for real functions.

42
00:04:13,643 --> 00:04:17,191
We just want a linear approximation around this point.

43
00:04:17,391 --> 00:04:20,958
Which means the slope at this point should exists.

44
00:04:21,586 --> 00:04:26,029
and of course a slope we usually calculate with a difference quotient.

45
00:04:27,014 --> 00:04:32,214
So we have the difference in the output divided by the difference in the input.

46
00:04:33,014 --> 00:04:37,248
In other words what you see here is the slope of a secant.

47
00:04:38,029 --> 00:04:42,436
and in order to get the slope of the tangent, we have to consider the limit.

48
00:04:42,871 --> 00:04:47,308
Hence, z goes to z_0 and this limit should exist.

49
00:04:47,886 --> 00:04:54,094
and in fact this is the whole definition of complex differentiability at a given point z_0.

50
00:04:54,857 --> 00:04:58,971
However I think I should say a few words what this limit means here.

51
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:04,300
Of course as often the formal definition is the same as for real numbers.

52
00:05:05,043 --> 00:05:10,136
However, we immediately find different consequences when we deal with complex numbers.

53
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,594
Before we discuss them let's first look at the definition here.

54
00:05:15,543 --> 00:05:23,147
The definition of the limit means that we consider all sequences z_n in the set U, but they shouldn't take the value z_0.

55
00:05:23,829 --> 00:05:27,684
However they all should converge to the point z_0.

56
00:05:28,343 --> 00:05:33,251
Now, for each of the sequences z_n, we get a new sequence here.

57
00:05:33,771 --> 00:05:39,100
and of course the claim here is that this new sequence here also converges.

58
00:05:39,417 --> 00:05:45,326
and also the limit we get out here does not depend on the chosen sequence z_n.

59
00:05:45,526 --> 00:05:47,909
We always get the same number out.

60
00:05:48,957 --> 00:05:53,275
So please remember this is just the meaning of this symbol here.

61
00:05:53,886 --> 00:05:58,174
Indeed in real analysis we have exactly the same definition.

62
00:05:58,843 --> 00:06:02,526
However there you can split the limit into two parts.

63
00:06:03,286 --> 00:06:07,749
You could approximate this from the right hand side or the left hand side,

64
00:06:08,343 --> 00:06:12,351
because in R, in the real numbers, we have an order.

65
00:06:12,551 --> 00:06:16,168
and you already know we don't have an order in C.

66
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:22,594
Indeed, if you want to converge into this point z_0, we have a lot of directions.

67
00:06:23,343 --> 00:06:33,822
So you immediately see, with all these directions this limit here is more complicated than the real differentiability, we have in real analysis.

68
00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:39,771
So it looks the same, but here we immediately have a 2 dimensional problem.

69
00:06:40,757 --> 00:06:47,569
Ok, I would say, how all this is related to the linear approximation as we have it for real functions,

70
00:06:47,769 --> 00:06:49,843
we will discuss in the next video.

71
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:56,711
and then we also look at examples and then you will see why complex analysis is so interesting.

72
00:06:57,571 --> 00:07:00,059
Therefore I hope I see you there and have a nice day.

73
00:07:00,259 --> 00:07:01,100
Bye!

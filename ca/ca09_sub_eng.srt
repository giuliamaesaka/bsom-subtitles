Hello and welcome back to complex analysis.

2
00:00:04,914 --> 00:00:11,503
and first many, many thanks to all the nice people that support this channel on Steady, via Paypal or by other means.

3
00:00:12,214 --> 00:00:17,441
Please don't forget, as an supporter you get a PDF version and a quiz for this video.

4
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,671
Now, todays part 9 will be about power series.

5
00:00:22,471 --> 00:00:26,872
Indeed, this is a very important topic in a complex analysis course.

6
00:00:27,586 --> 00:00:33,385
In the case you have watched my real analysis course, you already know a lot about power series.

7
00:00:34,543 --> 00:00:41,147
Now it turns out, for this concept in the complex numbers, we can do exactly the same as in the real numbers.

8
00:00:41,771 --> 00:00:48,785
Moreover by working with complex numbers we will find the true nature of the behaviour of some power series.

9
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:55,419
Hence you need to work in the complex realm to understand power series completely.

10
00:00:55,871 --> 00:01:00,172
and why this is important, i can immediately show you with an example.

11
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:05,916
Namely one of the most important functions is given by a power series.

12
00:01:07,043 --> 00:01:11,196
This is the exponantial function denoted by exp(z).

13
00:01:11,743 --> 00:01:16,634
and now you know the value of the function is defined by an infinite sum.

14
00:01:16,834 --> 00:01:21,188
There we have z^k divided by k!.

15
00:01:22,286 --> 00:01:25,832
Now, this definition you should know for real numbers,

16
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:32,483
but then we don't have any problems also putting complex numbers into the formula.

17
00:01:32,857 --> 00:01:37,037
Of course then in general the outcome is also a complex number.

18
00:01:37,886 --> 00:01:43,114
Here please don't forget, this symbol infinity means there is a limit involved.

19
00:01:43,843 --> 00:01:52,949
This means we have a limit of complex numbers and because you know how to measure distances in a complex plane, you don't have any problem with this.

20
00:01:53,857 --> 00:01:58,254
Regarding this there is simply not much difference to the real counterpart.

21
00:01:59,414 --> 00:02:06,387
Now with this philosophy we can also talk about the general definition of a power series in the complex field.

22
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:12,953
In other words if you know the definition for real numbers, you know exactly what comes now.

23
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:20,572
Of course the starting point should be the coefficients we have in the infinite series and are now complex numbers.

24
00:02:21,257 --> 00:02:25,255
and a fitting name is just a_0, a_1, a_2 and so on.

25
00:02:25,686 --> 00:02:31,350
Ok, then for these numbers we can define a complex function, we can call f.

26
00:02:31,986 --> 00:02:37,129
Moreover the domain we call D. So we have a function from D into C.

27
00:02:38,257 --> 00:02:48,919
Then this map is defined by sending z to the infinite series of the coefficient a_k times z^k.

28
00:02:49,543 --> 00:02:58,530
However, since later it will be important that we can shift the whole function by a fixed number z_0, i already introduce it here.

29
00:02:59,171 --> 00:03:02,671
So we simply have (z - z_0)^k.

30
00:03:03,257 --> 00:03:08,469
and i can already tell you this z_0 is often called the expansion point.

31
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:15,134
Of course what is still missing here is the explizit definition of the domain D.

32
00:03:15,671 --> 00:03:21,755
However you might already know this, because here in the definition of the map there is a limit involved.

33
00:03:22,643 --> 00:03:28,183
And maybe this limit does not exist for all complex numbers z we can choose.

34
00:03:28,771 --> 00:03:34,135
Hence this restriction is now what we have to put into the definition of D.

35
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:39,652
So we can say: we have all the complex numbers z, where this limit exists.

36
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:44,101
Or in other words we simply say the series is convergent.

37
00:03:45,314 --> 00:03:54,198
Ok, then you see we have a well defined function. Maybe the domain is very small, but still we always call this function a power series.

38
00:03:55,186 --> 00:03:58,585
With this knowledge i would say we look at an example.

39
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:03,661
This is an important one and you already know it from real analysis.

40
00:04:04,457 --> 00:04:07,066
It's the famous geometric series.

41
00:04:08,029 --> 00:04:12,603
It's not complicated at all, because all coefficients are just 1.

42
00:04:13,014 --> 00:04:18,190
Therefore we have the series that start with k=0 of z^k.

43
00:04:19,357 --> 00:04:29,450
Now, in fact by using exactly the same proof as in real analysis, we can show that this series has the value 1/(1-z).

44
00:04:30,214 --> 00:04:36,917
However you might already know, this proof only works if the absolute value of z is less than 1.

45
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:43,629
Indeed if the absolute value of z is greater or equal than 1, then this series does not converge.

46
00:04:44,543 --> 00:04:50,695
In other words the domain D here is the ball around 0 with radius 1.

47
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:58,070
and this is such an important fact, that you really should remember it, because we can use it a lot in the future.

48
00:04:58,643 --> 00:05:02,614
Moreover please recall the notation we use for the epsilon ball.

49
00:05:02,657 --> 00:05:09,871
So it's the open ball, so we call it B and the radius is 1. So we have an index 1 and the middle point is just 0.

50
00:05:11,057 --> 00:05:21,230
Ok, so what you see here in the complex plane: we have a circle and inside we have convergence and outside we have divergence.

51
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:29,387
Now it turns out that for any power series this situation is not essentialy more difficult.

52
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:33,905
Indeed the following fact follows from the geometric series.

53
00:05:34,629 --> 00:05:41,355
It simply tells us that for a given power series, there is a maximal radius r for this circle here.

54
00:05:41,986 --> 00:05:48,201
Or to say it more concretely, the open ball with radius r lies completely in D.

55
00:05:49,014 --> 00:05:56,446
So you see the only difference from before is that we don't need equality and also the middle point should be z_0 now.

56
00:05:56,957 --> 00:06:04,786
So here you see the worst case for r would be to be 0, which means there is only 1 point in D, z_0.

57
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,464
and the best case scenario would be that r is infinity.

58
00:06:09,529 --> 00:06:12,476
Which means D is just the whole complex plane.

59
00:06:12,986 --> 00:06:24,310
So by using formulas we would write: r comes from the interval 0 to infinity. However, also infinity should be included as a symbol.

60
00:06:24,857 --> 00:06:29,238
Therefore to be precise we would distinguish between 2 cases here.

61
00:06:30,343 --> 00:06:35,232
Of course i told you before, the second case is just that D is the whole complex plane.

62
00:06:35,786 --> 00:06:40,545
This is the best case, because there the power series converges everywhere.

63
00:06:41,186 --> 00:06:49,149
In the other case please note that we know, that somewhere on the boundary or outside of the ball, we have divergence.

64
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:57,705
Indeed, because this r is chosen maximally, the result is that everywhere outside we have divergence.

65
00:06:58,657 --> 00:07:01,798
Therefore the general picture looks like this.

66
00:07:02,571 --> 00:07:13,149
In the complex plane we have this ball with z_0 in the middle and with radius r and in the inside of this ball convergence is quaranteed.

67
00:07:13,929 --> 00:07:18,307
Moreover in the outside of this ball, divergence is quaranteed.

68
00:07:18,943 --> 00:07:23,040
The only thing we don't know in general is what happens at the boundary.

69
00:07:23,986 --> 00:07:28,171
Indeed, depending on the power series different things could happen there.

70
00:07:29,171 --> 00:07:34,137
For example for the geometric series the boundary was completely divergent as well.

71
00:07:35,214 --> 00:07:40,328
However, for a different power series you could have convergence or both cases mixed.

72
00:07:40,886 --> 00:07:45,569
Ok, then lets state the divergence part here also with a formula.

73
00:07:46,286 --> 00:07:52,104
Now, the outside in this complex plane here, could be described as this set difference.

74
00:07:52,657 --> 00:07:56,914
So it simply means that z is not an element of this ball.

75
00:07:57,314 --> 00:08:02,790
However, then the boundary would be included so we have to exclude this as well.

76
00:08:03,514 --> 00:08:07,582
We can simply do this by taking the closure of this ball.

77
00:08:08,157 --> 00:08:12,835
So this notation simply means: this is the set including the boundary.

78
00:08:13,543 --> 00:08:17,434
So in this case it's not the open ball, it's the closed ball.

79
00:08:18,329 --> 00:08:24,769
Now, for points that are not in this closed ball we know that the power series here is divergent.

80
00:08:25,529 --> 00:08:32,806
So in summary you should see this here is a very nice result, we can use a lot when we deal with power series.

81
00:08:33,543 --> 00:08:42,093
Indeed, it's not hard to prove. We can just use the root criterion from real analysis and combine it with the geometric series here.

82
00:08:43,071 --> 00:08:48,112
Ok, if you are interested in seeing this prove, please let me know in the comments.

83
00:08:48,729 --> 00:08:54,714
Now, for the end here i can tell you, often it's sufficient to know that there exists such an r,

84
00:08:54,829 --> 00:08:58,429
but sometimes it would be nice to have an explizit formula for it.

85
00:08:59,157 --> 00:09:02,674
Then we would be able to calculate this value of r.

86
00:09:03,371 --> 00:09:08,992
Probably you already know this formula. It's often called the Cauchy-Hadamard theorem.

87
00:09:09,771 --> 00:09:15,386
In fact this is what we have discussed in my real analysis course in part 33.

88
00:09:16,071 --> 00:09:21,622
and it tells you that 1/r can be calculated by a lim sup.

89
00:09:22,457 --> 00:09:31,101
Namely we look at the coefficient a_k in the absolute value and then we take the k-th root of this real number.

90
00:09:32,114 --> 00:09:37,782
Then we take the lim sup k to infinity and we know this always exists.

91
00:09:38,329 --> 00:09:43,537
It's either a real number between 0 and infinity or this symbol infinity.

92
00:09:44,543 --> 00:09:49,308
and then simply the inverse of this number gives us our maximal r.

93
00:09:49,757 --> 00:09:56,027
There of course you should know, inverses with 0 and infinity are here defined by this formula.

94
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:01,844
Hence the best case scenario is: in this lim sup is 0.

95
00:10:02,514 --> 00:10:11,727
Ok, the last important thing i should tell you is that this maximal r is often called the radius of convergence for the power series.

96
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:19,729
and i would say it's a good exercise for you to calculate the radius of convergence for the exponential function from above.

97
00:10:20,486 --> 00:10:25,984
Ok, then i hope i see you next time, when we start talking about the uniform convergence.

98
00:10:26,686 --> 00:10:28,827
So have a nice day and see you there.

99
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:29,700
Bye!

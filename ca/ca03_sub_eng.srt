00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:04,035
Hello and welcome back to complex analysis.

2
00:00:04,886 --> 00:00:11,628
and as always first i want to thank all the nice people that support this channel on Steady, via Paypal or by other means.

3
00:00:12,543 --> 00:00:17,617
Now, today in part 3 we continue talking about complex differentiability.

4
00:00:18,071 --> 00:00:25,610
More precisely we introduce the complex derivative and i'll explain to you why this gives us a linear approximation.

5
00:00:26,186 --> 00:00:30,358
and finally at the end of the video, i show you concrete examples.

6
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:38,708
However first please recall that the domain of the function we consider is always an open set, we call U.

7
00:00:39,114 --> 00:00:44,086
Moreover from this set U we always fix a point z_0.

8
00:00:45,186 --> 00:00:50,018
Now, because this set is open, z_0 is always an inner point.

9
00:00:50,471 --> 00:00:55,518
Which means that there are a lot of points around it, such that limits makes sense.

10
00:00:56,571 --> 00:01:03,200
Indeed this is what we need, when we want to define that the function f is differentiable at the point z_0.

11
00:01:04,057 --> 00:01:10,810
and if we want to make it clear that we have a complex function here, we say complex differentiable at z_0.

12
00:01:11,829 --> 00:01:18,339
Now, we have seen in the last video that this definition here looks exactly the same as for real functions.

13
00:01:18,539 --> 00:01:21,069
Namely, that the following limit exists.

14
00:01:21,943 --> 00:01:26,298
Indeed this is the slope of the function at a given point.

15
00:01:26,498 --> 00:01:29,670
and often it is called the differentiable quotient.

16
00:01:30,457 --> 00:01:36,021
Now since this describes the slope, we can refomulate it to a linear approximation.

17
00:01:36,529 --> 00:01:42,243
The only problem is that the visualisation is not so good when we deal with complex numbers.

18
00:01:43,214 --> 00:01:48,130
Here i mean that for a real valued function, you can simply draw the graph of the function.

19
00:01:48,771 --> 00:01:50,856
So maybe it could look like this.

20
00:01:51,714 --> 00:01:58,258
However for a complex function the input is the complex plane and the output is the complex plane.

21
00:01:58,757 --> 00:02:04,119
Hence the corret visualisation of the graph of the function should live in 4 dimensions.

22
00:02:04,943 --> 00:02:08,598
So you see there is no way i can correctly draw this here.

23
00:02:09,414 --> 00:02:15,719
Hence we just take an abstract picture then, where the x-axis represents the whole complex plane C.

24
00:02:16,557 --> 00:02:22,157
and in the same way the output, the y-axis also represents the whole complex plane.

25
00:02:22,637 --> 00:02:25,429
So you see we lose a lot of information here.

26
00:02:25,443 --> 00:02:29,457
It's not the best picture at all, but we can see the linear approximation then.

27
00:02:30,529 --> 00:02:36,540
In other words we approximate the function f around this point z_0 with a linear function.

28
00:02:37,314 --> 00:02:41,847
Therefore you recognize, this works exactly as for real valued functions.

29
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:48,979
So we get a statement that is equivalent to our definition of being differentiable at the point z_0.

30
00:02:49,557 --> 00:02:54,644
Namely we just have to give this expression a new name and we call it a function delta.

31
00:02:55,543 --> 00:03:00,982
and this delta gets an index, where we write the function f and the point z_0.

32
00:03:01,643 --> 00:03:07,598
Then you see z could be any point from U, so we have a function from U to C.

33
00:03:08,171 --> 00:03:16,182
Ok and now we can just reformulate this expression here and we get the property the function delta_f,z_0 should have.

34
00:03:16,543 --> 00:03:23,858
Namely f(z) can be written as the constant f(z_0), so the value at the point z_0

35
00:03:24,714 --> 00:03:28,098
+ a linear term times the delta function.

36
00:03:28,757 --> 00:03:35,181
Of course this property here holds for every function f. So we need one more ingredient here.

37
00:03:35,971 --> 00:03:39,610
and here please recall, we want that this limit exists.

38
00:03:40,557 --> 00:03:47,084
Hence this means that the function delta_f,z_0 is continuous at the point z_0.

39
00:03:47,743 --> 00:03:53,945
Hence this continuity property is really what we need and this one makes the differentiability.

40
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:02,114
Now, with this linear part here you might already see why we call this a linear approximation of the function f.

41
00:04:02,886 --> 00:04:09,509
If you have never seen this, you can watch my real analysis course, where i talk a lot about linear approximations.

42
00:04:10,371 --> 00:04:14,666
However here, we finally should define the derivative of the function f.

43
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:19,177
This not so complicated, because now we have everything.

44
00:04:19,729 --> 00:04:24,698
Moreover you might already know the derivative is denoted with f'.

45
00:04:25,114 --> 00:04:28,671
and then in parentheses we write the point z_0.

46
00:04:29,386 --> 00:04:38,002
and now by definition the value of the derivative is simply the output of the delta function we get, when we put z_0 into it.

47
00:04:38,614 --> 00:04:46,865
and now because delta_f,z_0 is a continuous function at the point z_0, we can calculate this number with a limit.

48
00:04:47,529 --> 00:04:49,623
Namely, simply this limit here.

49
00:04:50,629 --> 00:04:53,712
Or in other words, it's simply the same thing.

50
00:04:54,314 --> 00:05:00,074
and now this complex number we call the derivative of f at the point z_0.

51
00:05:00,829 --> 00:05:09,533
and again if you want to make it clear that we work with complex functions, you speak of the complex derivative of f at z_0.

52
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:18,363
So you see the definition is not complicated at all, but please always keep in mind: f'(z_0) is a complex number.

53
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:23,186
Ok, then i think we are ready to look at 2 simple examples.

54
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:30,183
The first one we consider should always be the linear polynomial, but now the complex valued one.

55
00:05:30,943 --> 00:05:36,643
So we have a function f, where the domain U can be chosen as the whole complex plane C.

56
00:05:36,971 --> 00:05:41,475
and the definiton of this complex function would be f(z)

57
00:05:42,343 --> 00:05:48,419
is equal to a complex number m times z + another complex number c.

58
00:05:49,214 --> 00:05:54,092
So this is simply the common linear polynomial, but now complex valued.

59
00:05:54,986 --> 00:06:00,800
There, because the function is already linear, a linear approximation will not change  so much.

60
00:06:01,357 --> 00:06:07,418
However lets try for a given z_0 to rewrite the function in this form.

61
00:06:07,957 --> 00:06:11,043
Hence first we need f(z_0).

62
00:06:11,614 --> 00:06:16,087
Which is not so complicated, because it's simply m times z_0 + c.

63
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:22,037
and then we want to add (z - z_0) times something.

64
00:06:22,529 --> 00:06:26,559
Now of course this something we now can figure out.

65
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:31,029
What we want to get in the end here is m times z + c

66
00:06:31,471 --> 00:06:35,757
The c we have already got, so we have to get rid of this term here.

67
00:06:36,986 --> 00:06:41,393
Of course this is no problem for us, because we can multiply this term by m.

68
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:48,284
Then z_0 times m will cancel out and the only thing that remains is z times m.

69
00:06:48,484 --> 00:06:52,214
Or in other words, now we have rewritten the function.

70
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:58,659
The first term is f(z_0) and this part here is our function delta.

71
00:06:59,214 --> 00:07:05,329
The function is constant. It's equal to m, so we don't have any problem putting z_0 into it.

72
00:07:06,371 --> 00:07:10,855
Hence we know the derivative, no matter which point z_0 we choose.

73
00:07:11,329 --> 00:07:14,489
The derivative is always equal to m.

74
00:07:15,157 --> 00:07:20,370
This shouldn't be a surprise to you, because the m stands for the slope of the linear function here.

75
00:07:21,143 --> 00:07:26,819
However still now we have proven that this function is indeed complex differentiable.

76
00:07:27,019 --> 00:07:30,814
and indeed no matter which point z_0 we consider.

77
00:07:31,786 --> 00:07:36,752
Ok, for the next part lets look at an example that a function is not differentiable.

78
00:07:37,371 --> 00:07:41,057
Again lets take the domain as the whole complex plane.

79
00:07:41,529 --> 00:07:47,355
and now the definition of the function should be that z is send to the complex conjugate of z.

80
00:07:47,929 --> 00:07:51,480
So with our notation we would right z bar.

81
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:56,041
So you see this is not a complicated function at all.

82
00:07:56,557 --> 00:08:01,966
To see what the function does, lets draw the input space here and the output space here.

83
00:08:02,657 --> 00:08:06,425
So our function f maps from the left hand side to the right hand side.

84
00:08:07,286 --> 00:08:16,270
Now lets take any point z from the domain and then the function f just flips this point with respect to the x-axis.

85
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,164
The real part of the numbers stays the same, but the imaginary part gets a different sign.

86
00:08:22,986 --> 00:08:27,257
So you see this reflection is all the function f does.

87
00:08:27,914 --> 00:08:33,041
Therefore it's not hard to show that this function is indeed a continuous function.

88
00:08:33,857 --> 00:08:40,364
However it turns out that it's not differentiable. No matter at which point z_0 we look.

89
00:08:41,029 --> 00:08:48,452
and this is immediately interesting, because in real analysis it's not so simple to find such a strange function.

90
00:08:49,543 --> 00:08:53,671
Indeed in complex analysis this property is not strange at all.

91
00:08:54,557 --> 00:09:02,080
In order to see this i would suggest that we try calculating the derivative at the point z_0 = 0.

92
00:09:02,771 --> 00:09:06,646
Indeed all the other points will work exactly the same.

93
00:09:07,443 --> 00:09:14,265
Now by definition, if the derivative exists f'(0) is given by our limit.

94
00:09:14,743 --> 00:09:20,289
So we have f(z) - f(0) divided by (z - 0).

95
00:09:20,914 --> 00:09:26,537
So we can immediately simplify this, because when we when we flip 0, we don't change anything.

96
00:09:27,243 --> 00:09:32,276
Hence we have the limit z to 0 of z bar divided by z.

97
00:09:32,943 --> 00:09:38,141
Ok and now it turns out that exactly this limit does not exist.

98
00:09:39,157 --> 00:09:47,343
In order to see this please recall that z to 0 here means that in a complex plane we have a lot of possibilities.

99
00:09:48,257 --> 00:09:51,600
So we can go from different directions into 0.

100
00:09:52,329 --> 00:09:58,049
For example we could use the real number line to go from the right hand side into 0.

101
00:09:58,543 --> 00:10:03,758
For example with the sequence z_n = 1 over n.

102
00:10:04,643 --> 00:10:10,071
Hence there the question is: what is z_n bar divided by z_n?

103
00:10:10,486 --> 00:10:16,302
Of course this is not so hard to see. This is 1 over n divided by 1 over n.

104
00:10:17,086 --> 00:10:21,532
Or in other words, it does not depend on n. It's always the same number, 1.

105
00:10:22,214 --> 00:10:26,754
Therefore also in the limit n to infinity, we get out 1.

106
00:10:27,429 --> 00:10:32,111
So the conclusion is, if this limit exists it has to be 1.

107
00:10:32,686 --> 00:10:36,750
That this can't be true we see, when we look in another direction.

108
00:10:37,943 --> 00:10:42,882
Now lets use the imaginary axis and one from the bottom to 0.

109
00:10:43,386 --> 00:10:50,652
For example this can be done with the sequence z_n is equal to -i divided by n.

110
00:10:51,429 --> 00:10:57,343
So again we have the same question. What is z_n bar divided by z_n?

111
00:10:57,877 --> 00:11:02,026
So now in the numerator we actually have a flip.

112
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:09,246
It's simply +i divided by n divided -i divided by n.

113
00:11:10,814 --> 00:11:15,508
Therefore we can cancel everything and the only thing that remains is the - sign.

114
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:17,155
So we get out -1.

115
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:22,282
So we see, also in the limit n to infinity this is -1.

116
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:28,225
Which is of course not the same as before. So this is not equal.

117
00:11:28,971 --> 00:11:33,841
Therefore the conclusion is: The limit from before does not exist.

118
00:11:34,857 --> 00:11:40,778
In other words f is not differentiable at the point z_0 = 0.

119
00:11:41,271 --> 00:11:46,008
Accordingly we immediately have a counterexample for differentiability.

120
00:11:46,957 --> 00:11:52,956
Here please recall i already told you, you can do the same prove for every other point z_0.

121
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:58,646
So the conclusion is indeed, the function is nowhere complex differentiable.

122
00:11:59,043 --> 00:12:05,779
At first this might be surprising, because the function is continuous and indeed a very simple function.

123
00:12:06,743 --> 00:12:14,586
In fact we can reformulate this and say that differentiability for complex functions is a very strong property.

124
00:12:15,429 --> 00:12:18,787
and i can promise you, this will get very apparent soon.

125
00:12:19,543 --> 00:12:22,830
and with this i hope i see you in the next video.

126
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:23,957
Bye!

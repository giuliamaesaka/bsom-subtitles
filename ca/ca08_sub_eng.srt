00:00:00,543 --> 00:00:03,958
Hello and welcome back to complex analysis.

2
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:11,221
and as always, first I want to thank all the nice people that support this channel on Steady, via Paypal or by other means.

3
00:00:12,014 --> 00:00:20,171
Today in part 8 we will continue talking about the Cauchy-Riemann equations and I will also explain what Wirtinger derivatives are.

4
00:00:20,786 --> 00:00:27,890
For this as often, we consider a complex function f, that is holomorphic on an open domain U.

5
00:00:28,771 --> 00:00:36,862
and for such a function we will define a new differential operator as a partial derivative with respect to the variable z.

6
00:00:37,614 --> 00:00:45,449
Then when we apply this to the function f and look at a given point z_0, this is often called the Wirtinger derivative.

7
00:00:46,414 --> 00:00:51,694
However, this is not quite correct, because there is also another Wirtinger derivative.

8
00:00:52,371 --> 00:00:59,075
This one is a little bit strange, because it's written as the partial derivative with respect to z bar.

9
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:06,654
However it turns out that both things here are well defined and indeed useful for our theory.

10
00:01:07,214 --> 00:01:15,197
For example: for a holomorphic function f this one here should give us the complex derivative of f at the point z_0.

11
00:01:15,771 --> 00:01:20,477
With this in mind, we will be able to define this new differential operator.

12
00:01:21,543 --> 00:01:28,172
Also, then we will see that for a holomorphic function, the other Wirtinger derivative should be 0.

13
00:01:28,986 --> 00:01:35,027
Therefore let's first concentrate at the Wirtinger derivative on the left hand side. df/dz.

14
00:01:35,614 --> 00:01:42,105
Now, to make our life a little bit easier let's write (x + iy) instead of the point z_0.

15
00:01:42,771 --> 00:01:47,621
So this means, this is the complex derivative of f at the given point.

16
00:01:47,821 --> 00:01:53,388
Hence it's just another complex number, which we can write as (a + ib).

17
00:01:54,571 --> 00:02:02,194
and now this is what we have learned in the last videos. The real part and the imaginary part can be written as partial derivatives.

18
00:02:03,229 --> 00:02:10,960
This works when we take the real part of the function f as a function u and the imaginary part of f as a function v.

19
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:18,438
and then this "a" here is du/dx and b is dv/dx.

20
00:02:19,743 --> 00:02:26,191
Of course both partial derivatives here are to be evaluated at the given point (x, y).

21
00:02:26,391 --> 00:02:32,450
However in the upcoming calculation we will omit this point to make everything clearer.

22
00:02:33,357 --> 00:02:38,070
Of course now in the next step here we want to use the Cauchy-Riemann equations.

23
00:02:39,271 --> 00:02:45,297
and in order to include them correctly the best thing we can do is to double this complex number here.

24
00:02:45,943 --> 00:02:51,519
So you see, we add the same number again, but then we have to divide everything by 2.

25
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:57,994
and now the idea is, that here in the second part we apply the Cauchy-Riemann equations.

26
00:02:58,971 --> 00:03:03,171
So instead of du/dx we can write dv/dy.

27
00:03:03,671 --> 00:03:09,396
and on the other hand dv/dx can be written as -du/dy.

28
00:03:10,271 --> 00:03:18,933
Ok, what you now should see is that some symmetry is involved. We have 2 partial derivatives with respect to x and 2 with respect to y.

29
00:03:19,771 --> 00:03:27,665
and this is what we can apply to our knowledge that u is the real part of the function f and v the imaginary part.

30
00:03:28,429 --> 00:03:35,661
Or in other words we can also look at the map that has (x, y) as an input, but a complex number as an output.

31
00:03:36,314 --> 00:03:40,795
Namely f at the point (x + iy) should be the output.

32
00:03:41,243 --> 00:03:47,834
So you see as the map f_R this carries exactly the same information as the map f.

33
00:03:48,657 --> 00:03:51,139
It's just again another point of u.

34
00:03:51,686 --> 00:03:57,282
and this helps us, because this function we can write as u + iv.

35
00:03:57,482 --> 00:04:02,848
and now you might already see, on the left-hand side we use exactly this.

36
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:10,580
Here the first part we can write as the partial derivative with respect to x of u + iv.

37
00:04:10,971 --> 00:04:17,043
and now in order to get this in the second part as well you see we have to pull out a -i

38
00:04:17,671 --> 00:04:25,499
and when we do this, you see we also have the partial derivative now with respect to y of u + iv.

39
00:04:26,871 --> 00:04:31,038
Ok, so this is the result for f' you really should remember.

40
00:04:31,614 --> 00:04:38,208
Indeed it's easier to remember when we use that (u + iv) are essentially the function f.

41
00:04:38,814 --> 00:04:43,110
Hence we can just define 2 new differential operators.

42
00:04:44,143 --> 00:04:49,773
Namely we just call the first one df/dx and the second one df/dy.

43
00:04:50,343 --> 00:04:57,966
and indeed this makes sense. This one is the partial derivative with respect to x, when you see f as this map here.

44
00:04:58,729 --> 00:05:04,143
Ok, soon I will show you an example and then these 2 operations should be clear.

45
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:12,456
However first I want to define the Wirtinger derivatives, because with this calculation here we already know how to do this.

46
00:05:13,071 --> 00:05:18,456
We can just use combinations of the partial derivatives with respect to x and y.

47
00:05:19,257 --> 00:05:29,814
Firstly, now when we write d/dz. This should stand for 1/2 times d/dx - i*d/dy.

48
00:05:30,786 --> 00:05:34,514
So you see, this is exactly what we have learned above.

49
00:05:35,171 --> 00:05:41,471
The definition makes sense and for a holomorphic function f it gives us the complex derivative of f.

50
00:05:42,357 --> 00:05:47,022
Ok, now in a similar way we will define d/dz(bar).

51
00:05:48,357 --> 00:05:56,244
and indeed this should look very similarly. So we also take 1/2 times, and now d/dx + i d/dy.

52
00:05:56,943 --> 00:06:06,232
We do this, because you see by the Cauchy-Riemann equations, we get 0 when we apply this operation to a holomorphic function f.

53
00:06:07,243 --> 00:06:11,469
and here please recall. This fits to our motivation from the beginning.

54
00:06:11,929 --> 00:06:15,627
Ok, then as promised let's look at an example.

55
00:06:16,071 --> 00:06:19,976
It shouldn't be a complicated one. So let's look at a polynomial.

56
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:24,550
Namely we just look at a quadratic function z^2.

57
00:06:24,957 --> 00:06:29,848
Which means using x and y, we have (x + iy)^2.

58
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:41,763
Hence, let's just expand the square. Which means we have x^2 - y^2 + i2xy.

59
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:48,463
Therefore this first part here is our function u and this part is our function v.

60
00:06:49,029 --> 00:06:57,384
With this we can immediately calculate df/dx, which is here 2x + i2y.

61
00:06:58,014 --> 00:07:06,883
and similarly we can calculate df/dy, which is here -2y + i2x.

62
00:07:07,629 --> 00:07:15,551
Now, both things can be simplified when we just use the fact, that (x+iy) is the complex number z.

63
00:07:16,243 --> 00:07:20,939
Hence, df/dx is simply 2 times z.

64
00:07:21,857 --> 00:07:27,434
and in a similar way you see for df/dy we have 2 times i times z.

65
00:07:28,086 --> 00:07:31,638
So we can always use that i^2 is -1.

66
00:07:32,714 --> 00:07:39,054
Now, with these 2 nice short expressions we should be able to calculate with 2 Wirtinger derivatives.

67
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:43,993
So let's start with the second one, df/dz(bar).

68
00:07:44,314 --> 00:07:51,736
It's 1/2 (2z + i times 2iz).

69
00:07:52,571 --> 00:07:57,384
Again, we know i^2 is -1. So we get 0 here.

70
00:07:58,229 --> 00:08:02,568
This is what we expected, because the polynomial is a holomorphic function.

71
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:07,491
Ok, then in the next step it's not hard to calculate df/dz.

72
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:11,955
It's the same calculation as before, but now with a minus sign here.

73
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:21,545
Therefore in this case, in the parentheses we have (2z + 2z) divided by 1/2, gives us back 2z.

74
00:08:22,643 --> 00:08:29,352
Also here the result is not so surprising, because it should give us the complex derivative of f.

75
00:08:29,552 --> 00:08:36,384
Ok, then I would say let's summarize the video by stating the important fact we have proven here.

76
00:08:36,886 --> 00:08:40,505
Indeed, this is something one can nicely remember.

77
00:08:41,486 --> 00:08:53,967
Namely, a complex function f defined on an open domain U is holomorphic if and only if df/dz(bar) is equal to 0 at all points.

78
00:08:54,471 --> 00:09:01,291
Indeed, this equivalence you already know, because here we simply have hidden the Cauchy-Riemann equations.

79
00:09:02,214 --> 00:09:10,338
and then in this case as we have proven above the other Wirtinger derivative gives us the complex derivative of f.

80
00:09:11,071 --> 00:09:15,370
So f' can be calculated by using df/dz.

81
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:22,701
Ok, with this you now know a lot of different differential operators we can use in complex analysis.

82
00:09:23,714 --> 00:09:28,420
Then I hope that I see you in the next video, where we will talk about power series.

83
00:09:29,557 --> 00:09:31,594
Have a nice day! Bye!

Hello and welcome back to complex analysis.

2
00:00:04,714 --> 00:00:11,081
and before we start i want to thank all the nice people that support this channel on Steady, via Paypal or by other means.

3
00:00:12,057 --> 00:00:15,895
Now, here you see we've already reached part 10 in this series.

4
00:00:16,557 --> 00:00:22,443
Therefore it's time to start talking about the important concept of uniform convergence.

5
00:00:22,829 --> 00:00:28,057
The definition for this convergence is indeed exactly the same as in real analysis.

6
00:00:28,786 --> 00:00:34,984
Moreover you will also see that in complex analysis we can immediately apply it to the power series.

7
00:00:35,614 --> 00:00:39,334
However lets first start with the formal definition.

8
00:00:39,534 --> 00:00:46,134
So what we need is a sequence of functions. Now they are complex functions with the same domain U.

9
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:50,668
This means for each natural number n we have a function f_n here.

10
00:00:51,643 --> 00:00:56,052
Additionally we need another function f, which should be our limit.

11
00:00:56,443 --> 00:01:03,178
Hence we say: the sequence of functions f_n is uniformly convergent to another function f,

12
00:01:03,771 --> 00:01:11,065
if the supremum norm of (f_n - f) goes to 0 when n goes to infinity.

13
00:01:11,614 --> 00:01:16,642
and as usual the supremum norm is denoted with an infinity symbol in the index.

14
00:01:17,429 --> 00:01:22,307
Now in the case that you have never seen the supremum norm, lets quickly define it.

15
00:01:23,086 --> 00:01:28,721
In fact the only thing we need is that the values of the functions that are involved are numbers.

16
00:01:29,357 --> 00:01:35,743
Then it does not matter if we have real or complex numbers, because we can always take the absolute value.

17
00:01:36,571 --> 00:01:41,500
and then we are just interested in the largest value that can come out or more precisely

18
00:01:41,529 --> 00:01:44,829
we look at the supremum where we go through all numbers z.

19
00:01:45,857 --> 00:01:53,308
and now what we want for the uniform convergence is that this supremum goes to 0, when n increases to infinity.

20
00:01:54,200 --> 00:02:02,130
So please note, we don't just fixed the point z and look at the convergence, we look at all points at the same time in the limit.

21
00:02:02,586 --> 00:02:06,640
and exaclty this makes the convergence here uniform.

22
00:02:07,357 --> 00:02:12,170
Ok, now this notion helps us a lot when we deal with power series.

23
00:02:13,086 --> 00:02:18,107
In fact this is such an important result that we can use it a lot in complex analysis.

24
00:02:19,129 --> 00:02:24,160
Essentially it tells us that all power series are holomorphic functions.

25
00:02:24,829 --> 00:02:29,974
Later we will see that in some sense the reverse implication is also true.

26
00:02:30,586 --> 00:02:36,065
However lets first start with the statement here, which holds in general for all power series.

27
00:02:36,686 --> 00:02:42,600
So you see what we have is a power series with coefficients a_k and expansion point z_0.

28
00:02:43,529 --> 00:02:48,583
Now, the only thing we put in is that the radius of convergence is greater than 0.

29
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:52,165
It could be infinity, but it's not 0.

30
00:02:52,614 --> 00:02:58,337
To say it differently the power series here is convergent at a different point than z_0.

31
00:02:58,971 --> 00:03:04,299
Therefore we can define this function on the whole open ball B_r(z_0).

32
00:03:04,957 --> 00:03:10,551
I always call it ball, but you now, in the 2-dimensional complex plane it's a disk.

33
00:03:11,114 --> 00:03:15,137
Therefore sometimes i speak of the open disk around z_0.

34
00:03:15,971 --> 00:03:24,362
Now, from the last video you know inside this open disk we have convergence, but now we see, we also have uniform convergence.

35
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:33,659
In fact we have this for this power series here, when we see it as a function defined on B_c(z_0).

36
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:39,886
So we have a number c as a radius involved, which is smaller than the radius of convergence.

37
00:03:40,914 --> 00:03:47,854
and this is very important, because we don't know if we have convergence on the boundary of this disk here.

38
00:03:48,486 --> 00:03:56,115
However, if we make our ball a little bit smaller, now we know we have also convergence on the boundary, on the circle.

39
00:03:57,343 --> 00:04:01,508
Therefore we can also include the boundary in this statement here.

40
00:04:02,329 --> 00:04:06,199
and there you know, the closed ball is denoted with this line here.

41
00:04:07,071 --> 00:04:14,674
Ok, if you are not used to working with series and power series, here you see an alternative formulation of this statement.

42
00:04:15,286 --> 00:04:22,228
I simply give you the explizit definition of sequence of functions f_n, we need for the uniform convergence.

43
00:04:22,871 --> 00:04:26,470
and you see, it's defined by using partial sums.

44
00:04:27,329 --> 00:04:33,211
and now this sequence of functions converges uniformly to the function f.

45
00:04:33,411 --> 00:04:38,714
However, only when we restrict f_n to the closed ball B_c(z_0).

46
00:04:39,686 --> 00:04:47,772
Ok, so this is the first statement and the next 2 will tell us that the power series is indeed a holomorphic function.

47
00:04:48,643 --> 00:04:52,806
In order to show this we have to look at the formal complex derivative here.

48
00:04:53,757 --> 00:04:58,165
So the power k comes in front and we reduce the exponend by 1.

49
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:06,514
We already know this works for polynomials. So when we have an end index here, but we don't know if this also works for power series.

50
00:05:07,386 --> 00:05:11,404
But you will believe me, this is exactly what we want to proof now.

51
00:05:11,857 --> 00:05:19,541
The first step for this is that similarly to before we also get an uniform convergence for this new power series here.

52
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:29,276
More precisely here we can also say, we have a sequence of functions f_n' that converge uniformly to this function here.

53
00:05:29,814 --> 00:05:36,924
Indeed here the name f_n' is justified, because it's the complex derivative of this polynomial here.

54
00:05:37,929 --> 00:05:46,080
Of course in the end this is what we want when we have the derivative of f. We want to approximate it with these derivatives here.

55
00:05:46,714 --> 00:05:51,463
and obviously exactly this should be our last statement, three.

56
00:05:51,914 --> 00:05:58,856
Hence we can write: the function f is complex differentiable and the derivative is given by this formula.

57
00:05:59,471 --> 00:06:05,264
So maybe this is not such a big surprise, but still it's a very nice result for us.

58
00:06:06,029 --> 00:06:12,843
and here please recall f is defined on an open domain and complex differentiable at all points.

59
00:06:13,043 --> 00:06:17,748
Hence, the power series gives us immediately a holomorphic function.

60
00:06:18,557 --> 00:06:23,544
So with this result we immediately get a lot of examples for holomorphic functions.

61
00:06:24,271 --> 00:06:31,181
In summary, in order to understand complex analysis, you really should remember this whole result here.

62
00:06:32,129 --> 00:06:40,602
In a few words we could say this result tells us that each power series is holomorphic on its open disk of convergence.

63
00:06:41,743 --> 00:06:46,201
Of course if you really to believe this result, we should prove it.

64
00:06:46,957 --> 00:06:50,777
However this will take some time. So lets do this in the next video.

65
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:55,143
Therefore i hope i see you there and have a nice day. Bye!

Hello and welcome back to complex analysis.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,565
and as always, first I want to thank all the nice people that support this channel on Steady, via Paypal or by other means.

3
00:00:12,457 --> 00:00:16,621
Now, this part 4 is about holomorphic and entire functions.

4
00:00:17,257 --> 00:00:24,467
So you see, we are still at the beginning of this interesting field such that we first have to fix the manner of speaking here.

5
00:00:25,343 --> 00:00:30,692
In fact the definition of a holomorphic function is what we need throughout this course.

6
00:00:31,586 --> 00:00:33,755
Therefore let's immediately start with this.

7
00:00:33,955 --> 00:00:37,243
So we consider a function f with domain U.

8
00:00:38,057 --> 00:00:41,329
and of course this should be a complex valued function.

9
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:48,715
Now, we have talked about this before. The domain U should always be an open subset of the complex numbers.

10
00:00:49,771 --> 00:00:55,967
So it does not matter how it looks like in the complex plane. The important thing is, it's an open set.

11
00:00:56,786 --> 00:01:01,429
However later we will see that often we have a very nice looking domain.

12
00:01:02,657 --> 00:01:08,820
Nevertheless, still it's very helpful to introduce holomorphic functions in this general sense.

13
00:01:09,743 --> 00:01:11,471
Hence let's immediately do this.

14
00:01:11,829 --> 00:01:19,334
So a function f is called holomorphic, if f is complex differentiable at all points.

15
00:01:19,986 --> 00:01:23,571
So you see it's not a complicated definition at all.

16
00:01:23,644 --> 00:01:29,386
It just tells us that the complex derivative makes sense no matter which point z_0 we choose.

17
00:01:30,429 --> 00:01:34,671
Therefore sometimes it can be helpful to emphasis the domain again.

18
00:01:34,943 --> 00:01:37,475
So we would say holomorphic on U.

19
00:01:38,357 --> 00:01:39,971
So what you should remember is

20
00:01:40,114 --> 00:01:47,900
a holomorphic function is just a complex valued function that is differentiable at all points of an open set.

21
00:01:48,414 --> 00:01:53,214
Now in the literature also see that other names than holomorphic are used.

22
00:01:54,243 --> 00:01:57,886
For example some people speak of regular functions.

23
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:04,343
Moreover you also sometimes see the term complex analysis used for this definition here.

24
00:02:05,257 --> 00:02:09,608
However later i will tell you what this term should actually mean.

25
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,930
It has something to do with power series.

26
00:02:13,857 --> 00:02:21,091
Ok, now there is another special name for holomorphic functions, whose domain is the whole complex plane.

27
00:02:22,157 --> 00:02:27,998
For this largest possible domain the holomorphic function is then called an entire function.

28
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:33,743
So in other words, entire just means holomorphic on C.

29
00:02:34,357 --> 00:02:40,022
Ok, by knowing this we can now talk about some basic properties of holomorphic functions.

30
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,818
Let's start with the properties we can immediately adapt from the real valued counterparts.

31
00:02:47,014 --> 00:02:52,004
First we know the proof that differentiability implies continuity.

32
00:02:53,029 --> 00:02:59,392
Hence in complex analysis this means that a holomorphic function is always a continuous function.

33
00:03:00,257 --> 00:03:05,874
Indeed for showing this fact we can exactly redo the proof we did in real analysis.

34
00:03:06,829 --> 00:03:10,289
and this is what we can do for a lot of basic facts here.

35
00:03:11,014 --> 00:03:17,484
For example we still have our sum and product rule for derivatives, when we consider 2 functions.

36
00:03:18,457 --> 00:03:26,890
Therefore this implies, if f and g are holomorphic functions, the sum and the product are also holomorphic functions.

37
00:03:27,943 --> 00:03:32,335
Of course this is a fact, we will naturally use a lot in calculations.

38
00:03:33,571 --> 00:03:40,043
Ok, now besides the sum and the product rule, you also now the chain and quotient rule for derivatives.

39
00:03:40,857 --> 00:03:45,166
and also for them we can just redo the proof from real analysis.

40
00:03:46,171 --> 00:03:52,056
Therefore we can just state sum, product, quotient and chain rule still hold.

41
00:03:52,586 --> 00:03:58,784
For example you can check my video about the chain rule for real functions and when you see the proof,

42
00:03:58,786 --> 00:04:05,146
you will see that you can do the same steps, when you consider complex numbers instead of real numbers.

43
00:04:05,971 --> 00:04:12,429
Ok, by knowing this i think we are ready to talk about some important examples of holomorphic functions.

44
00:04:13,443 --> 00:04:19,755
Now, by simply using the rules from above we immediately see that polynomials are entire functions.

45
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:26,586
More precisely this means that we have a function f, where the domain is the whole complex plane

46
00:04:26,976 --> 00:04:31,777
and where f(z) is given as a sum with fixed coefficient "a".

47
00:04:32,486 --> 00:04:35,186
So we have a_m times z to the power m

48
00:04:35,243 --> 00:04:39,773
+ a_(m-1) times z to the power (m-1)

49
00:04:39,973 --> 00:04:41,150
+ and so on

50
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,721
until we reach the constant term. The coefficient a_0.

51
00:04:45,371 --> 00:04:50,284
However here please keep in mind, the coefficients are fixed complex numbers.

52
00:04:51,443 --> 00:04:55,391
Now such a function here we call a complex polynomial.

53
00:04:55,591 --> 00:05:00,293
and if a_m is nonzero, we call m the degree of the polynomial.

54
00:05:01,043 --> 00:05:08,104
Of course here its not hard to see, using our sum and product rule, that a polynomial is a holomorphic function.

55
00:05:08,886 --> 00:05:13,595
and because there is no restriction in the domain, it's also an entire function.

56
00:05:14,529 --> 00:05:21,129
Indeed just by using induction, you can calculate the derivative f' for every point z.

57
00:05:21,729 --> 00:05:23,786
and now it might not surprise you

58
00:05:23,843 --> 00:05:29,329
this is m times a_m times z to the power (m-1)

59
00:05:30,171 --> 00:05:37,704
+ (m-1) times a_(m-1) times z to the power (m-2)

60
00:05:38,357 --> 00:05:45,008
+ and so on, until we reach 2 times a_2 times z to the power 1.

61
00:05:45,486 --> 00:05:49,387
and finally + the new constant term, a_1.

62
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,625
So you see, this is what you really should remember.

63
00:05:53,825 --> 00:05:57,786
More precisely, when you want to calculate the derivative of such a term

64
00:05:57,829 --> 00:06:02,886
it just means you bring the exponent in front and reduce the exponent by 1.

65
00:06:03,857 --> 00:06:08,609
Hence the polynomial is still a nice function in the complex numbers.

66
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,294
In fact the same holds for rational functions. 

67
00:06:12,371 --> 00:06:15,129
Where we simply divide two polynomials 

68
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:21,353
However, because we have a denominator there, the domain can't be the whole complex plane.

69
00:06:22,243 --> 00:06:26,052
This means that we have to exclude the zeros of the denominator.

70
00:06:26,957 --> 00:06:32,891
For example in the case that we consider the function f(z) is given by 1 over z.

71
00:06:33,586 --> 00:06:40,008
Then we are not allowed to divide by 0. Therefore we have to exclude 0 from the domain.

72
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:47,231
Now the important thing to note here is, in the case we exclude finitely many points from the complex plane,

73
00:06:47,243 --> 00:06:49,242
we still get an open set.

74
00:06:50,214 --> 00:06:57,466
Therefore we can combine this fact with the quotient rule and conclude that this function is also holomorphic.

75
00:06:58,429 --> 00:07:03,730
Now, obviously this whole argumentation also works for any rational function.

76
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,374
So in summary a rational function is also a holomorphic function.

77
00:07:10,157 --> 00:07:18,379
Now as a reminder the definition of a rational function is simply given as one polynomial p divided by another one, q.

78
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,516
So f(z) = p(z) divided by q(z).

79
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:29,374
Then the finite set S, we have to exclude here, is simply given by the zeros of q.

80
00:07:30,071 --> 00:07:34,141
Hence all points z in C, where q(z) = 0.

81
00:07:35,086 --> 00:07:38,548
Now such rational functions often occur in applications.

82
00:07:38,748 --> 00:07:42,116
Therefore it's good to know that they are also holomorphic.

83
00:07:42,914 --> 00:07:47,357
However please keep in mind. In general they are not entire functions.

84
00:07:48,543 --> 00:07:55,654
Ok, with this we have some examples we can work with and of course later we will talk about other examples as well.

85
00:07:56,129 --> 00:08:00,814
But first, in the next video we will talk about the Cauchyâ€“Riemann equations.

86
00:08:01,643 --> 00:08:06,977
In fact these equations will explain why complex analysis is so interesting.

87
00:08:07,571 --> 00:08:11,136
Therefore i really hope that i see you in the next video.

88
00:08:11,336 --> 00:08:12,171
Bye!

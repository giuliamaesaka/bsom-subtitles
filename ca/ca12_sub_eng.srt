00:00:00,643 --> 00:00:03,838
Hello and welcome back to complex analysis


2
00:00:04,386 --> 00:00:11,327

and as you might know, first i want to thank all the nice people that support this channel on Steady, via Paypal or by other means.

3
00:00:11,943 --> 00:00:16,532
now in today's part 12 we look at more examples for holomorphic functions.

4
00:00:17,529 --> 00:00:21,323
In particular we look at examples that are given by a power series,

5
00:00:22,314 --> 00:00:29,087
because we have already learned, a power series is a holomorphic function on its open disc of convergence.

6
00:00:29,514 --> 00:00:34,290
Also you know in the best case this disc is the whole complex plane.

7
00:00:35,171 --> 00:00:42,302
Now, please remind yourself, holomorphic just means that the complex derivative f' exists everywhere.

8
00:00:43,114 --> 00:00:49,941
Moreover we also have shown that f' is then also a power series with the same disc of convergence.

9
00:00:50,357 --> 00:00:55,158
In conclusion this means that f' is also holomorphic.

10
00:00:56,114 --> 00:01:00,886
Hence the second derivative f'' does also exist


11
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:06,086
and by the same reasoning it's also a power series with the same disc of convergence.

12
00:01:06,629 --> 00:01:12,018
So you see where this goes. All derivatives of f exist and are holomorphic functions.

13
00:01:13,214 --> 00:01:15,900
Ok, this is something you really should remember.

14
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:20,914
It's a strong result that holds for holomorphic functions that are given by a power series.

15
00:01:21,514 --> 00:01:27,538
Indeed later we will see that for all holomorphic functions the higher derivatives exist,

16
00:01:28,314 --> 00:01:31,449
but first let's discuss some important examples.

17
00:01:32,586 --> 00:01:36,060
The first one, again should be the exponential function.

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,350
Here you already know exp(z) is given by a power series from k is equal to 0 to infinity

19
00:01:44,014 --> 00:01:47,796
and then we have z to the power k divided by k factorial.

20
00:01:48,843 --> 00:01:54,383
Now I know the radius of convergence you have already calculated and we get r is infinity.

21
00:01:55,714 --> 00:01:59,560
This means that the exponential function is an entire function.

22
00:02:00,457 --> 00:02:06,201
So we know that the derivative of the exponential function exists everywhere and we can calculate it.

23
00:02:06,957 --> 00:02:10,556
We simply can do this in the series term by term.

24
00:02:11,543 --> 00:02:15,657
Hence here k comes in front and we reduce the power by 1.

25
00:02:16,157 --> 00:02:18,925
So you see, this is not complicated at all.

26
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:28,046
However here please don't forget, k=0 corresponds to the constant term, which always vanishes for the derivative.

27
00:02:29,129 --> 00:02:32,886
In other words the new series now should start with 1.

28
00:02:34,043 --> 00:02:39,659
Ok, now the nice thing we should see here is that we can cancel this k with k factorial.

29
00:02:40,771 --> 00:02:45,209
Therefore in the denominator only (k-1) factorial remains.

30
00:02:46,186 --> 00:02:52,740
So now this is a very nice expression and you see we can do an index shift to simplify it even more.

31
00:02:53,643 --> 00:03:03,085
So instead of starting with 1 we start with m=0 again and here please note, the new index m should represent k-1.

32
00:03:03,671 --> 00:03:08,170
Hence we have z to the power m divided by m factorial

33
00:03:09,186 --> 00:03:13,800
and with this result you see we get the original exponential function back.

34
00:03:14,714 --> 00:03:17,968
So taking the derivative does not change the function.

35
00:03:18,557 --> 00:03:23,715
In fact this means that all the derivatives of the exponential function are the same

36
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:27,976
and this is an important property you should remember.

37
00:03:28,643 --> 00:03:37,913
Ok then let's go to the next example. Which is the cos(z) and of course we also define this function via a power series.

38
00:03:38,543 --> 00:03:44,161
However this one is a little bit special, because only even powers of z occur here.

39
00:03:45,357 --> 00:03:49,757
For this reason we have to use the number 2 times k here and here.

40
00:03:50,386 --> 00:03:54,829
Otherwise you should recognize, it's very similar to the exponential function.

41
00:03:55,629 --> 00:04:00,342
However there is also another difference, because there is a sign involved.

42
00:04:01,371 --> 00:04:05,143
So you see, some powers in this series get a minus sign.

43
00:04:06,143 --> 00:04:09,939
For example z to the power 2 gets a minus sign.

44
00:04:10,543 --> 00:04:15,990
Then z to the power 4 is plus again and z to the power 6 gets a minus sign again.

45
00:04:16,814 --> 00:04:21,344
Ok, there we have it. This is the definition of the complex cosine function

46
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:27,753
and then I think you don't have any problems calculating the derivative similarly to before.

47
00:04:28,429 --> 00:04:31,514
Therefore i would suggest that we do something else here

48
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,286
and look which connection we find between the exponential function and the cosine function.

49
00:04:37,314 --> 00:04:43,959
Indeed we find something with the help of complex numbers, because "i" squared is -1.

50
00:04:44,557 --> 00:04:50,486

For this reason one idea would be to put "i" times z into the exponential function.

51
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:55,324
This is not so complicated, because we have the whole power series here.

52
00:04:56,057 --> 00:05:01,968
Then what we should see is, here in the numerator we have essentially 4 different cases.

53
00:05:02,943 --> 00:05:07,070

We get this because the powers of "i" have a periodic structure.

54
00:05:07,671 --> 00:05:16,546
So maybe let's start with the simplest case, when k=1. Then we simply have "i" times z to the power k.

55
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:22,809
Of course this is not so surprising, but the same thing happens when k=5.

56
00:05:23,471 --> 00:05:33,153
We simply have this, because "i" to the power 5 is "i" again and of course this also holds when we increase k by 4.

57
00:05:34,343 --> 00:05:39,983
Okay, there you see we have one case where the factor in front of z to the power k is simply "i".

58
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:49,355
Now, in our next case this factor is -1. Of course this happens when we square our imaginary unit "i".

59
00:05:50,057 --> 00:05:55,209
So it holds for k=2, k=6, k=10 and so on.

60
00:05:56,229 --> 00:06:01,379
Okay by having this you already see the
next case should be k=3.

61
00:06:02,514 --> 00:06:11,013
Hence we need to know what "i" cubed is. You can say it's "i" squared times "i". Therefore simply "-i".

62
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,526
Now with this only the last case is missing, where we have k=0, 4 and so on.

63
00:06:18,329 --> 00:06:24,475
So let's put this case at the top and then you should know, "i" to the power 4 is simply 1.

64
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:30,057
Therefore in this case the factor in front of z to the power k is just 1.

65
00:06:30,771 --> 00:06:35,367
Ok, so you see this is very nice, but please keep our goal in mind.

66
00:06:35,743 --> 00:06:41,229
In order to get from the exponential function to the cosine, there shouldn't be any "i" involved

67
00:06:41,714 --> 00:06:45,414
and also only the even case should matter here.

68
00:06:46,286 --> 00:06:54,660
Therefore we have to get rid of these two cases here and the idea is to do this with another exponential function.

69
00:06:55,486 --> 00:07:00,978
It turns out putting "-i" times z into the exponential function helps a lot.

70
00:07:01,429 --> 00:07:08,824
Of course the power series here looks very similarly to before and we also can consider 4 different cases.

71
00:07:09,643 --> 00:07:18,552
So maybe we can discuss them very quickly, because we only have to multiply with the factor -1 to the power k in these cases.

72
00:07:19,557 --> 00:07:26,315
Hence for the even numbers we don't change anything and for the odd numbers a -1 is included.

73
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,983
So let's copy the cases there and there and add a minus sign for the odd cases.

74
00:07:32,471 --> 00:07:35,444
Hence minus here and plus there.

75
00:07:36,443 --> 00:07:44,696
Ok, so you see here our idea is now, that we look at the sum exp(iz) plus exp(-iz).

76
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:53,461
Then you see the terms where "i" is involved will simply cancel out and only the terms with an even k remain.

77
00:07:54,357 --> 00:07:58,232
Then you see, this is almost what we want for the cosine.

78
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,511
Ok, maybe to make the whole thing here clearer, let's use the index m again.

79
00:08:04,286 --> 00:08:13,255
Now please recall, only the even powers are involved. So our exponent is 2 times m and in the denominator we have 2m factorial.

80
00:08:14,229 --> 00:08:19,934
However please be careful. We also have a sign involved, depending in which case we are.

81
00:08:20,443 --> 00:08:24,381
Hence we have to add the factor -1 to the power m

82
00:08:24,857 --> 00:08:29,243
Moreover also please don't forget, we have the addition here.

83
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:34,957
So we add the two cases or to put it in other words, we also get a factor 2.

84
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:43,108
Ok, now we are finished and you see with the exception of this factor, this is exactly our cos(z).

85
00:08:43,943 --> 00:08:49,768
Of course that was our goal. Now we have the relation between cosine and the exponential function.

86
00:08:50,729 --> 00:08:56,151
This is very nice, because we can also use this relation to calculate the derivative.

87
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:05,237
So first let's state the formula again. Cosine can be written as 0.5 times (exp(iz) plus exp(-iz)).

88
00:09:06,143 --> 00:09:11,761
Then of course we can simply use the chain rule to calculate the derivative of cos(z).

89
00:09:12,771 --> 00:09:16,629
Now the inner derivative gives us the factor "i" in front.

90
00:09:17,029 --> 00:09:22,414
This happens for the first and the second exponential, but the second also gets a minus sign

91
00:09:23,086 --> 00:09:28,855
and otherwise we can simply use the fact, that the derivative of the exponential is the exponential again.

92
00:09:29,557 --> 00:09:37,495
There we have it this is the derivative of the cosine and you might already know, this should be -sin(z).

93
00:09:38,457 --> 00:09:43,847
Hence also for the sine we now have a representation with exponential functions

94
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:51,425
and now these two representations can be very helpful, when you do calculations with cosine and sine involved.

95
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:58,594

Simply because powers of exponential functions are easier to deal with than powers of cosine or sine.

96
00:09:59,471 --> 00:10:07,342
However in our course here, it's very important to know that exp, cos and sin are all holomorphic functions.

97
00:10:08,243 --> 00:10:15,929
Ok, I think that's good enough for today and I really hope that I see you in the next video. Have a nice day and bye!

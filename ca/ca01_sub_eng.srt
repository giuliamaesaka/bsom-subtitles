Hello and welcome to a new series about complex analysis

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,855
and before we start i really want to thank all the nice people that support this channel on Steady or Paypal.

3
00:00:12,571 --> 00:00:19,058
Now this is part 1 in this series and we just start with a short introduction and some basic definitions.

4
00:00:20,029 --> 00:00:26,510
So the topic is called complex analysis, because it deals with functions defined on the complex plane.

5
00:00:27,243 --> 00:00:33,279
More concretely we consider differentiable functions f with domain C and codomain C.

6
00:00:34,471 --> 00:00:42,178
So you see it's different from our real analysis course, where we have the real number line R as domain and codomain.

7
00:00:43,057 --> 00:00:49,322
Now soon we will see that this makes a major difference in the definition of differentiability

8
00:00:50,114 --> 00:00:55,972
and from that a lot of strong theorems will follow. Which indeed don't hold in real analysis.

9
00:00:57,114 --> 00:01:07,971
However since the real number line R is a subset of the complex plane C, we can often apply these theorems even if we just consider some real functions.

10
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:17,128
For example a real problem, where complex analysis can be really helpful is calculating an improper Riemann integral.

11
00:01:18,371 --> 00:01:26,994
This could be the integral from - infinity to infinity of the function: (x * sin(x)) / (1 + x^2).

12
00:01:27,971 --> 00:01:33,442
Now indeed finding an antinderivative of this function is really, really hard.

13
00:01:34,471 --> 00:01:40,823
However just calculating the whole integral with complex analysis is surprisingly simple.

14
00:01:41,671 --> 00:01:49,196
Indeed the result we find is a number slightly larger than 1. Namely it's pi divided by e.

15
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:54,382
How to do this simple calculation here, we will learn in this course.

16
00:01:55,129 --> 00:01:59,057
However of course first we have to start with the basics.

17
00:01:59,686 --> 00:02:05,981
and i already told you in contrast to real analysis we immediately start with differentiability.

18
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:10,100
The definition first looks the same as in real analysis,

19
00:02:10,194 --> 00:02:13,039
but it's way more powerful as we will see.

20
00:02:14,171 --> 00:02:19,229
Now in order to understand this new definition, you will need to know some basic facts.

21
00:02:20,386 --> 00:02:27,386
First you need to know how to work with sets and of course you also need to know how to calculate with complex numbers.

22
00:02:28,357 --> 00:02:34,067
If you have problems there, you find everything you need in my "start learning mathematics" series.

23
00:02:34,771 --> 00:02:39,764
This is the whole playlist that covers all the basics you need for this course here.

24
00:02:40,414 --> 00:02:46,771
In addition, it's also good if you already have a basic knowledge of some topics of real analysis.

25
00:02:47,471 --> 00:02:53,793
For example you should know what a continuous or a differentiable function from R to R is.

26
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,629
Also could be very helpful for you, if you already know what a power series is.

27
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,455
For all these topics of course my real analysis series can help you.

28
00:03:06,214 --> 00:03:11,893
However you don't need to watch the whole course. Some videos about these topics might be sufficient.

29
00:03:13,243 --> 00:03:17,500
Ok, by knowing this i now thing we can start with the course.

30
00:03:18,343 --> 00:03:23,800
The first part will be about some definitions we will definitely need throughout the course.

31
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:30,316
First i can tell you, the complex numbers form a set with the distant function.

32
00:03:31,114 --> 00:03:34,694
Formally we call such a construction a metric space,

33
00:03:34,894 --> 00:03:37,793
but don't worry it's not complicated at all.

34
00:03:38,643 --> 00:03:43,087
It just means that the distance between two elements of the set make sense.

35
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,103
and of course we can immediately visualize this in the complex plane.

36
00:03:49,014 --> 00:03:53,556
This means that a complex number z can be found in this plane.

37
00:03:54,214 --> 00:03:59,743
and on the x-axis we find the real part of z and on the y-axis the imaginary part.

38
00:04:00,643 --> 00:04:05,478
Now you can imagine that we have a second complex number here, we call w.

39
00:04:06,657 --> 00:04:11,296
and now what we want to do is to measure the distance between both points.

40
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,311
Indeed this is what we calculate with the absolute value in C.

41
00:04:17,671 --> 00:04:22,833
and what we need is the absolute value of the complex number (z - w).

42
00:04:24,029 --> 00:04:32,977
Now such a notion of a distance is important, because with a distance we can say: what a convergent sequence is, what limits are and so on.

43
00:04:33,814 --> 00:04:39,220
Otherwise we wouldn't be able to say that a sequence gets closer and closer to a given point.

44
00:04:40,043 --> 00:04:42,761
Indeed we have to measure this closeness.

45
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:49,464
Hence, now we are able to talk about sequences of complex numbers and convergent sequences.

46
00:04:50,429 --> 00:04:57,253
So a sequence of complex numbers is denoted by z_n, where n goes through all natural numbers.

47
00:04:58,071 --> 00:05:04,143
So formally we just have a map that goes from the natural numbers into the complex numbers C.

48
00:05:04,535 --> 00:05:08,160
However we will always write the sequence in this form.

49
00:05:08,929 --> 00:05:16,339
and now we are able to define what it means that this sequence is convergent to a fixed complex number "a".

50
00:05:17,314 --> 00:05:26,035
It just means that the distance, we can measure between z_n and "a" gets smaller and smaller until it reaches 0 in the limit.

51
00:05:26,886 --> 00:05:30,829
This means that we can just look at a sequence of real numbers.

52
00:05:31,486 --> 00:05:36,114
Namely the sequence of the absolute value of (z_n - a).

53
00:05:37,171 --> 00:05:41,092
This is but a definition of the absolute value, a sequence of real numbers.

54
00:05:41,292 --> 00:05:43,414
Of non-negative real numbers.

55
00:05:44,543 --> 00:05:49,343
and now in the case that this sequence of real numbers goes to the limit 0,

56
00:05:49,443 --> 00:05:54,157
we call the sequence of complex numbers z_n convergent to "a".

57
00:05:54,829 --> 00:06:00,947
Now if you don't remember the definition of convergence for real numbers, lets recall it.

58
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:10,768
So we find that for all positive numbers we can call epsilon, there exists an index, we can call capital N

59
00:06:11,957 --> 00:06:18,017
such that for all indices afterwards, so n is greater or equal than capital N,

60
00:06:18,943 --> 00:06:24,916
we get that the distance between z_n and the point "a" is less than epsilon.

61
00:06:25,614 --> 00:06:30,442
So you see this is exactly the definition we learned in real analysis.

62
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,380
However now we can visualize it in the complex plane.

63
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:44,086
Now, this formular with the distance less than epsilon means that we can draw a circle around "a" with radius epsilon.

64
00:06:44,957 --> 00:06:51,167
With this we get that eventually the sequence member z_n lie inside this circle.

65
00:06:52,257 --> 00:06:55,302
So only finitely many can lie outside.

66
00:06:56,257 --> 00:07:02,876
and because this whole picture here is so important, we call the inside of the circle an epsilon ball.

67
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:08,162
and for the notation we use a capital B with index epsilon.

68
00:07:09,286 --> 00:07:14,055
Moreover the middle point "a" here, we put into parentheses afterwards.

69
00:07:14,671 --> 00:07:20,314
Now by definition this is the set of all the complex numbers w, with the property:

70
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:25,555
|w - a| is less than epsilon.

71
00:07:26,614 --> 00:07:31,098
So this is the definition of an epsilon-ball in the complex plane.

72
00:07:31,829 --> 00:07:36,813
Ok, because you now know what a convergent sequence in the complex numbers is,

73
00:07:37,186 --> 00:07:42,296
you also know what a continuous function between C and C is.

74
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,200
In fact it has exactly the same meaning as for real functions.

75
00:07:48,229 --> 00:07:55,722
Hence small deviations, small errors in the input should be translated into small errrors in the output.

76
00:07:56,457 --> 00:07:59,734
Indeed this can be formulated with sequences.

77
00:08:00,829 --> 00:08:06,643
Therefore we say a function is continuous at the point z_0 in C

78
00:08:07,243 --> 00:08:12,400
if for all sequences of complex numbers called z_n, we have

79
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:18,314
that if z_n is convergent to the point z_0, then also

80
00:08:18,986 --> 00:08:24,951
the images f(z_n) are convergent with limit f(z_0)

81
00:08:25,543 --> 00:08:31,834
Of course here we use a common notation that tells us that a sequence is convergent to a given point.

82
00:08:32,629 --> 00:08:43,525
No matter which notation we use, you should remember continuous at a given point just means that convergence in the input implies convergent in the output.

83
00:08:44,486 --> 00:08:49,446
Ok, so with this we have the definition of continuity for complex functions.

84
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:55,907
Therefore the next thing we need to define is the important notion of differentiability.

85
00:08:56,614 --> 00:09:01,879
This is what we will do in the next video, where we actually start with complex analysis.

86
00:09:02,214 --> 00:09:08,971
Now if you have any problems with these definitions in this video here, please check out my real analysis course.

87
00:09:09,771 --> 00:09:13,414
There i talk a lot about these definitions for real functions.

88
00:09:14,214 --> 00:09:19,009
However if you understand it, you can immediately translate this to complex functions.

89
00:09:19,986 --> 00:09:25,373
Ok, please also note the pdf version of this video, you can find in the description.

90
00:09:25,573 --> 00:09:27,875
as well as a quiz about this topic.

91
00:09:28,486 --> 00:09:30,257
Then i hope i see you next time.

92
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:31,243
Bye!

00:00:00,714 --> 00:00:04,186
Hello and welcome back to complex analysis.

2
00:00:05,214 --> 00:00:13,547
and you might already know, first as always I want to thank all the nice people that support this channel on Steady, via Paypal or by other means.

3
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:19,505
Now, finally in today's part 6, we will talk about the Cauchy-Riemann equations.

4
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:28,511
In order to understand them we first have to recall the 2 notions of differentiability we have for complex function.

5
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:34,875
The first is the normal one. The one we introduced at the start of this series.

6
00:00:35,729 --> 00:00:40,500
This one we simply called complex differentiable at a given point z_0.

7
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:49,303
Now, as a reminder in other videos I already explained, the domain here doesn't have to be the whole complex plane C.

8
00:00:50,043 --> 00:00:52,163
It's sufficient to have an open subset.

9
00:00:53,271 --> 00:00:59,414
However this might be distracting for this video here. Therefore I always write C for the domain.

10
00:01:00,186 --> 00:01:05,593
So if needed you can just substitute this domain with any open subset U.

11
00:01:06,471 --> 00:01:13,330
Ok, back to the differentiability here. This one can be described as a linear approximation in C.

12
00:01:13,614 --> 00:01:20,628
More precisely this means that we can find the complex number, we can call f'(z_0).

13
00:01:21,371 --> 00:01:24,386
Indeed, this could be any complex number.

14
00:01:25,457 --> 00:01:31,913
Then with this it's possible for us to write f(z) as a linear term + an error term.

15
00:01:32,629 --> 00:01:39,361
and you already know, everything happens locally around z_0. Therefore the constant term is f(z_0).

16
00:01:40,429 --> 00:01:46,243
Then next comes the linear map. Which has a slope given by f'(z_0).

17
00:01:46,957 --> 00:01:51,685
More precisely we have this number times (z - z_0).

18
00:01:52,757 --> 00:01:58,569
So you see again, this is the linear approximation of the function f around the point z_0.

19
00:01:59,314 --> 00:02:03,637
and please recall, in real analysis this represents the tangent.

20
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:09,557
Therefore the only thing missing here is a corresponding error term, we could call Phi.

21
00:02:10,114 --> 00:02:14,490
Of course this Phi is also a function from C to C.

22
00:02:15,129 --> 00:02:21,782
Now as an error function this map here should go to 0, when we send z to z_0.

23
00:02:22,686 --> 00:02:28,086
and this convergence to 0 should go faster to 0 than the linear function would do.

24
00:02:28,986 --> 00:02:39,600
Or more concretely Phi(z) divided by (z - z_0) should still go to 0, when we send z to z_0.

25
00:02:40,414 --> 00:02:46,112
Now, with this property we really get a linear approximation around the point z_0.

26
00:02:46,771 --> 00:02:53,583
Indeed, this is what we could read as the definition for complex differentiability at the point z_0.

27
00:02:54,243 --> 00:02:58,955
However to be honest it looks a little bit different than the definition we gave before.

28
00:02:59,786 --> 00:03:05,438
Yet I would say it's not hard at all to get this reformulation from our definition.

29
00:03:06,143 --> 00:03:09,651
and I guess it's a good exercise for you to think about it.

30
00:03:10,114 --> 00:03:16,099
After this you see, you simply can take this for the definition of complex differentiability.

31
00:03:16,757 --> 00:03:25,328
and that's a good thing, because we can nicely compare this to the definition of total differentiability we explained in the last video.

32
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,869
As a reminder, this definition we introduced for functions from R^2 into R^2.

33
00:03:32,571 --> 00:03:40,739
and there please recall, we have a 1 to 1 correspondence between functions from C to C and functions from R^2 into R^2.

34
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:45,929
Therefore often both functions are just called by the same name, f.

35
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:51,028
However to distinguish them I give the last one here an index R.

36
00:03:51,657 --> 00:03:57,547
Ok, now we can recall the definition of total differentiability for such functions.

37
00:03:58,443 --> 00:04:03,571
Also there we have to fix a point in the plane. So let's call it (x_0, y_0).

38
00:04:04,171 --> 00:04:12,446
Then we know the function is called totally differentiable at this point, if there exists a matrix J and an error map Phi.

39
00:04:13,014 --> 00:04:16,817
Please note I use another variant to denote the letter Phi here.

40
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:23,406
Then what we need is also a linear approximation. Now given by this matrix J.

41
00:04:24,186 --> 00:04:30,114
and lastly of course this error term here should also go to 0 in the same way as before.

42
00:04:30,786 --> 00:04:37,255
Which means if we divide it by the length of the difference vector, we still get out 0 in this limit.

43
00:04:37,914 --> 00:04:45,588
Here please note, before this 0 was the 0 in the complex numbers and now this 0, is the 0 vector in R^2.

44
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:52,723
However using the identification C with R^2, you could say they are exactly the same.

45
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:59,800
Therefore a natural question here would be: where exactly is the difference between both notions here?

46
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:04,329
So I would say let's try to spot all the differences.

47
00:05:05,343 --> 00:05:13,694
First this might be obvious, in the second case we see when we use the division here, we need the length of the vector.

48
00:05:14,543 --> 00:05:17,585
This is what you know, we can't divide vectors.

49
00:05:18,514 --> 00:05:26,071
However in the complex numbers we don't have this problem, we simply can divide one complex number by another one.

50
00:05:26,871 --> 00:05:34,610
Now, maybe this is not a crucial difference, because both things just explain that the error term goes to 0.

51
00:05:35,571 --> 00:05:39,895
and of course if we wanted, we also could use the absolute value here.

52
00:05:40,743 --> 00:05:44,486
Indeed this wouldn't change anything for the linear approximation here.

53
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:50,424
Therefore we have to look at the linear approximations to see the differences.

54
00:05:51,443 --> 00:05:56,977
Since we immediately see that the constant terms fit, we look at the linear terms here.

55
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:04,043
and there you see, this dot here stands for the multiplication in the complex numbers C.

56
00:06:04,943 --> 00:06:10,080
and that's the difference because this multiplication does not exist here.

57
00:06:10,743 --> 00:06:15,231
Indeed what we find here is a matrix-vector multiplication.

58
00:06:16,229 --> 00:06:22,157
Now exactly this does not translate in general to the multiplication in C.

59
00:06:22,771 --> 00:06:31,714
Therefore the conclusion is immediately this definition here, complex differentiability is much stricter than this definition there.

60
00:06:32,586 --> 00:06:40,921
and now in order to get a translation from the complex definition to the one in R^2, we have to answer one question.

61
00:06:41,786 --> 00:06:49,812
Namely in which cases does a matrix-vector multiplication represent a multiplication in the complex numbers.

62
00:06:50,829 --> 00:06:57,609
Now, because we know how to calculate with complex numbers, we can answer this question without any problem.

63
00:06:58,586 --> 00:07:02,932
Just let's check how the multiplication in the complex numbers looks like.

64
00:07:03,814 --> 00:07:08,497
So we take 2 complex numbers w and z, and multiply them.

65
00:07:09,271 --> 00:07:15,062
Of course here w and z have a real part and an imaginary part respectively.

66
00:07:15,786 --> 00:07:22,438
Therefore we say w = (a + ib) and z = (x + iy).

67
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:28,495
and now we just do the multiplication, where we use that i^2 is -1.

68
00:07:29,071 --> 00:07:36,209
Then we get: a times x - b times y + the imaginary part.

69
00:07:37,043 --> 00:07:40,568
Which is b times x + a times y.

70
00:07:41,386 --> 00:07:46,793
Of course this was not hard at all, because you know how to calculate with complex numbers.

71
00:07:47,686 --> 00:07:52,514
However now we want to rewrite this as a matrix-vector multiplication.

72
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:59,516
and the vector should represent the complex number z. Which means we have x and y as the coordinates.

73
00:08:00,314 --> 00:08:05,601
and on the left of it, we have a 2x2 matrix where the numbers a and b should occur.

74
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:10,566
and indeed how the entries exactly look like we have to figure out now.

75
00:08:11,571 --> 00:08:15,889
and of course this is no problem for us, because we already know the result.

76
00:08:16,771 --> 00:08:20,155
The first component should just be the real part here.

77
00:08:20,814 --> 00:08:24,285
and then the second component is just the imaginary part.

78
00:08:25,286 --> 00:08:30,302
and now the question is: Which 2x2 matrix brings us to this result?

79
00:08:31,071 --> 00:08:35,835
Now the first row we see immediately, because it should be "a" and -b.

80
00:08:36,657 --> 00:08:41,982
Of course in the same way we also see the second row. Which be b and a.

81
00:08:42,571 --> 00:08:48,656
and indeed that's it. This is the matrix that represents the multiplication of complex numbers.

82
00:08:49,514 --> 00:08:58,084
Therefore our conclusion here is, if we want complex differentiability we need that the Jacobian matrix here has this form.

83
00:08:59,014 --> 00:09:03,505
So I would say let's fix this important result with a theorem.

84
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:09,014
In fact in this theorem we will now find the Cauchy-Riemann equations.

85
00:09:09,814 --> 00:09:14,381
Ok in order to get everything together let's start with a complex function.

86
00:09:14,414 --> 00:09:18,457
That should be complex differentiable at a given point z_0.

87
00:09:19,357 --> 00:09:23,571
and now we can just split this point into a real and an imaginary part.

88
00:09:24,414 --> 00:09:28,901
and as before we call them x_0 and y_0 respectively.

89
00:09:29,729 --> 00:09:34,722
So with the reasoning from above we know that this statement here is equivalent to

90
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:44,798
The statement that the corresponding real function f_R from R^2 to R^2 is totally differentiable at the point (x_0, y_0)

91
00:09:45,157 --> 00:09:52,043
and that the Jacobian matrix at the point (x_0, y_0) has the symmetric form from above.

92
00:09:53,143 --> 00:09:58,571
So there you see this is our final connection between both notions of differentiability.

93
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:04,437
and exactly this connection now leads us to the Cauchy-Riemann equations.

94
00:10:05,343 --> 00:10:12,501
We simply get another equivalence when we use the fact that the Jacobian matrix has partial derivatives as entries.

95
00:10:13,329 --> 00:10:19,543
However in order to do this we have to introduce new names for the components of the function f_R.

96
00:10:20,357 --> 00:10:24,214
That's no problem at all, because we know we just have 2 components.

97
00:10:25,229 --> 00:10:29,036
The first one we simply call u and the second one v.

98
00:10:30,071 --> 00:10:33,963
Now both components depend on the 2 variables x and y.

99
00:10:34,557 --> 00:10:38,491
Therefore we simply write u(x, y) and v(x, y).

100
00:10:39,529 --> 00:10:45,015
In other words here we have 2 new maps that send R^2 to R.

101
00:10:45,971 --> 00:10:49,118
So please don't forget, here we just have real functions.

102
00:10:49,914 --> 00:10:58,291
Ok and now we know from the last video that in the top left corner for example we find the partial derivative of u with respect to x.

103
00:10:59,257 --> 00:11:04,807
and now you see, with the partial derivatives in the Jacobian matrix we find a connection.

104
00:11:05,729 --> 00:11:10,069
And exactly this connection is what we call the Cauchy-Riemann equations.

105
00:11:11,057 --> 00:11:15,141
There are just 2 partial equations for u and v.

106
00:11:15,871 --> 00:11:24,154
In particular the first one is simply that du/dx = dv/dy.

107
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:32,454
So here you see this equation just represents that we have the same number in the top left corner and in the bottom right corner.

108
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:38,438
Ok and then you might already see it. The number b here gives us the second equation.

109
00:11:39,186 --> 00:11:44,211
Which is du/dy = dv/dx.

110
00:11:45,014 --> 00:11:50,604
and of course both equations have to be fulfilled at the given point (x_0, y_0).

111
00:11:51,414 --> 00:11:59,050
Ok now you know that we have these 2 equivalences to describe complex differentiability at a given point.

112
00:11:59,743 --> 00:12:06,205
and of course then we can extend that to a whole open subset. We talk about holomorphic functions.

113
00:12:06,986 --> 00:12:13,468
In other words a holomorphic function has to fulfill the Cauchy-Riemann equations at all the points.

114
00:12:14,114 --> 00:12:16,514
Ok then i think it's good enough for today.

115
00:12:16,613 --> 00:12:19,745
Let's talk about examples in the next video.

116
00:12:20,343 --> 00:12:24,211
Therefore I hope I see you there and have a nice day. Bye!

00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,514
Hello and welcome back to probability theory.

2
00:00:04,129 --> 00:00:08,896
and as always first i want to thank all the nice people that support this channel on Steady or Paypal.

3
00:00:09,471 --> 00:00:13,562
Now in todays part 6 we will talk about the Hypergeometric distribution.

4
00:00:13,943 --> 00:00:18,350
It's the name for an important probability measure, we find for discrete cases.

5
00:00:18,771 --> 00:00:25,230
and here we will talk about the general formulation for it. Also called the multivariant Hypergeometric distribution.

6
00:00:25,714 --> 00:00:29,384
Here you can immediately keep 3 important ingredients in mind.

7
00:00:29,584 --> 00:00:32,500
First the size is given by a natural number n,

8
00:00:32,686 --> 00:00:35,804
The sample is unordered and without replacement.

9
00:00:36,557 --> 00:00:40,203
Hence a useful visualisation is again given by an urn model.

10
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:46,383
This means that in this model we take out n balls from the urn and look what we get.

11
00:00:46,583 --> 00:00:49,925
So we don't have an order and we don't replace the balls.

12
00:00:50,125 --> 00:00:53,659
Therefore in short you could say we draw n balls at once.

13
00:00:53,859 --> 00:00:59,054
and there you should see, this is only interesting if we have different coloured balls in the urn.

14
00:00:59,671 --> 00:01:02,486
For example we could have 4 different colours here.

15
00:01:03,043 --> 00:01:07,871
Hence our first question here is: how can we mathematically formulate this?

16
00:01:08,329 --> 00:01:13,682
First we can say that the different colours are just given by a finite set we call capital C.

17
00:01:14,343 --> 00:01:19,961
In our example here we could just index the colours, so we choose numbers from 0 to 3.

18
00:01:20,161 --> 00:01:25,951
Of course every set with 4 elements would do the work, but working with numbers is much easier for calculations.

19
00:01:26,857 --> 00:01:34,509
Also here in our simple example we could talk about possible outcomes, maybe in the case that n is equal to 5.

20
00:01:34,786 --> 00:01:41,336
One possible sample could be this one, where we have 2 green balls, 1 red ball, 1 blue ball and 1 orange ball.

21
00:01:41,943 --> 00:01:46,051
We don't have an order. We can just count how many balls of each colour we have.

22
00:01:46,743 --> 00:01:54,346
Hence in mathematical terms, here we would have a function from the set of colours, C into the natural numbers including 0.

23
00:01:55,014 --> 00:01:59,834
and there you see immediately it's very helpful to index the colours with numbers.

24
00:02:00,414 --> 00:02:05,124
Because then we can rewrite this function into a tuple with 4 coordinates.

25
00:02:05,686 --> 00:02:11,542
So in this example here we would have 2 green balls, 1 red one, 1 blue one and 1 orange one.

26
00:02:12,029 --> 00:02:16,893
So what we always should have is that the sum of all these numbers is equal to 5.

27
00:02:17,329 --> 00:02:21,489
Then this could be a possible outcome of our random experiment here.

28
00:02:21,689 --> 00:02:26,387
Ok now with this knowledge we are able to write down the sample space Omega.

29
00:02:26,587 --> 00:02:30,530
It's simple the set of all functions or tuples of this form.

30
00:02:31,171 --> 00:02:37,607
So in general we would say, we have numbers k_c, where the lower case c goes through all the colours in set C.

31
00:02:38,171 --> 00:02:43,269
and then we say, this is an element of the natural numbers including 0 to the power c.

32
00:02:43,469 --> 00:02:49,174
So this is the general notation of all the functions from the set C into N_0.

33
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:55,691
It's a helpful notation, because it reminds us that we can also rewrite the function as a tuple.

34
00:02:55,891 --> 00:02:58,890
and we also put that into this notation here.

35
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:04,243
Ok and now the only condition we have here is that all these numbers add up to n.

36
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,679
So we can simply write: sum of k_c is equal to n.

37
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,673
and then we have our whole sample space Omega.

38
00:03:12,243 --> 00:03:19,177
Of course you already know as for all discrete cases the sigma algebra is just chosen as just the power set of Omega.

39
00:03:19,414 --> 00:03:22,923
Therefore we can immediately go to the probability measure.

40
00:03:23,123 --> 00:03:27,749
and maybe also for this it's helpful to first look at our example here.

41
00:03:28,243 --> 00:03:32,009
For our example you already know we have tuples of 4 elements.

42
00:03:32,357 --> 00:03:38,126
Hence we can say we have k_0, k_1, k_2, k_3 from N_0 to the power 4.

43
00:03:38,326 --> 00:03:41,796
and also the sum should be the sample size n.

44
00:03:41,996 --> 00:03:46,571
Now you might already see for calculating the probability of an outcome,

45
00:03:46,657 --> 00:03:50,786
we have to know how many balls of each colour are actually in the urn.

46
00:03:51,114 --> 00:03:53,929
For this we have to introduce new variables.

47
00:03:54,327 --> 00:03:58,448
Hence capital N with index c stands for this number.

48
00:03:58,648 --> 00:04:04,155
and then of course the total number of balls in the urn is given by the sum of all these numbers.

49
00:04:05,014 --> 00:04:08,293
Here we will simply use the symbol N for it.

50
00:04:08,493 --> 00:04:12,713
Ok, now by knowing all this we can start calculating probabilities.

51
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:18,538
As always in discrete cases knowing the probability mass function is enough.

52
00:04:18,738 --> 00:04:22,143
Hence we just calculate the probability of a singleton.

53
00:04:22,871 --> 00:04:26,154
Now here we just have to count all the possibilities we can have.

54
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,401
and then we will have a fraction here.

55
00:04:30,071 --> 00:04:32,357
Ok, we already know what is in the denominator,

56
00:04:32,454 --> 00:04:37,826
because there we find all possibilities to take n balls from capital N ones.

57
00:04:38,357 --> 00:04:41,543
So we simply have capital N choose lower case n.

58
00:04:42,114 --> 00:04:47,471
Ok, then for the next step, you should see we want exactly k_0 green balls.

59
00:04:47,971 --> 00:04:51,162
So we simply have N_0 choose k_0.

60
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,304
and of course we have the same thing for all the other colours.

61
00:04:55,771 --> 00:04:59,980
Therefore in the next step we have times N_1 choose k_1.

62
00:05:00,529 --> 00:05:05,710
and then times N_2 choose k_2 times N_3 choose k_3.

63
00:05:06,143 --> 00:05:10,678
and with this we have our probability we call the hypergeometric distribution.

64
00:05:11,414 --> 00:05:15,192
Therefore in the next step lets formulate this in a general case.

65
00:05:15,392 --> 00:05:20,514
Also here we just give the probability mass function. So we put in a singleton.

66
00:05:20,714 --> 00:05:23,746
Which we describe as before as k_c.

67
00:05:23,946 --> 00:05:29,976
Then now you know we find a fraction, where in the numerator we find a product of all the colours.

68
00:05:30,357 --> 00:05:33,973
So we have the product symbol with N_c choose k_c.

69
00:05:34,173 --> 00:05:36,860
and the denominator we already know.

70
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:42,110
Ok and there we have it. This is the hypergeometric distribution in the general case.

71
00:05:42,657 --> 00:05:48,307
Now often only 2 colours are involved, which means the whole thing here gets very simple.

72
00:05:48,771 --> 00:05:53,999
However the simple case is also often known as the hypergeometric distribution.

73
00:05:54,543 --> 00:05:59,542
Therefore it might be worth it to write down the formulas for the special case as well.

74
00:05:59,743 --> 00:06:04,521
Of course the whole set up is the same, but we can make the sample space much simpler.

75
00:06:04,721 --> 00:06:09,772
The reason for that is that for two colours only one degree of freedom remains.

76
00:06:09,972 --> 00:06:15,814
For example if we draw n balls and we count the number of red balls, which means the number of ones

77
00:06:15,986 --> 00:06:19,771
We immediately get the number of green balls, which means the number of zeros.

78
00:06:20,486 --> 00:06:25,157
Hence if we just count the ones, we can say a sample is just the number.

79
00:06:25,357 --> 00:06:30,060
This means that we can take the sample space Omega as a set 0 to n.

80
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:34,643
and then of course we can also simplify the probability mass function here.

81
00:06:35,129 --> 00:06:39,811
So lets look at P of the singleton k and copy what we already know.

82
00:06:40,011 --> 00:06:42,724
Which means we have N choose n in the denominator

83
00:06:42,924 --> 00:06:45,581
and in the numerator we have 2 factors.

84
00:06:46,014 --> 00:06:51,371
Now here k_1 is simply our k and k_0 is (n-k).

85
00:06:51,758 --> 00:06:58,612
and also we don't have to write capital N_0 here, because we can use capital N - capital N_1.

86
00:06:58,986 --> 00:07:05,757
and there we have it. This is the compact formulation for the hypergeometric distribution when we only have two kinds of balls.

87
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:11,944
Now for the last part of this video let me show you, how you can find this distribution in R.

88
00:07:12,571 --> 00:07:16,318
It's simply given by "rhyper". So lets look at the manual here.

89
00:07:17,343 --> 00:07:24,900
So you see this is the hypergeometric distribution and if we scroll down you see rhyper and all the variables here.

90
00:07:25,429 --> 00:07:31,011
The arguments are explained below and this k here is actually our lower case n.

91
00:07:31,211 --> 00:07:36,567
and you also see the other variables stand for the number of white balls and the number of black balls.

92
00:07:37,329 --> 00:07:41,755
So in our formulation this would be capital N_1 and capital N_0.

93
00:07:42,357 --> 00:07:46,257
and additionally we have the first argument for the number of repetitions.

94
00:07:46,871 --> 00:07:54,671
Therefore i would say lets see what happens when we have one observation, 9 white balls, 3 black balls and we pull 5 balls out.

95
00:07:55,011 --> 00:07:57,817
Then when we hit enter, we see our outcome.

96
00:07:58,017 --> 00:08:01,318
So the number of white balls we got is just counted.

97
00:08:01,518 --> 00:08:04,772
Ok, then lets repeat the whole random experiment.

98
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:09,916
So here we got 3 white balls. Which means we got also 2 black ones.

99
00:08:10,586 --> 00:08:16,162
Ok so now maybe we can use the first argument to do a lot of repetitions of this random experiment.

100
00:08:17,071 --> 00:08:18,829
So lets say we do 20.

101
00:08:19,943 --> 00:08:23,433
So there you see we have a lot of of fours, but not a two.

102
00:08:23,957 --> 00:08:26,776
However we know that two is possible.

103
00:08:26,976 --> 00:08:30,023
Therefore maybe lets go to 200 observations.

104
00:08:32,471 --> 00:08:36,495
and there you see, we find some twos, but they are very unlikely.

105
00:08:37,043 --> 00:08:40,091
Hence to visualize that, lets put it into a histogram.

106
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:42,371
So we put "hist" in front.

107
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:45,637
and close the parentheses and hit enter.

108
00:08:46,543 --> 00:08:50,358
The first thing we note is that it's not the best visualization for a histogram yet,

109
00:08:50,558 --> 00:08:53,881
but we already have that two is very unlikely.

110
00:08:54,286 --> 00:09:00,186
Now one possibility to make the whole histogram nicer, is to tell R where it should put the bits.

111
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,514
and these break points we can put into a vector x.

112
00:09:04,329 --> 00:09:09,788
So lets choose steps of one, where we start at 1.5 and end at 5.5.

113
00:09:10,057 --> 00:09:13,029
So lets hit enter and there you see our x.

114
00:09:13,457 --> 00:09:18,607
and this vector x is now what we can put into the histogram function as an argument.

115
00:09:18,807 --> 00:09:25,498
This is not so complicated. We choose the histogram function and then we put in ", " and "breaks"

116
00:09:26,171 --> 00:09:29,522
and then these breaks should be equal to our vector x.

117
00:09:30,214 --> 00:09:33,173
and there you can see, this is what comes out.

118
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:36,795
So maybe lets repeat it to see immediately what can change.

119
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:43,769
So it's almost the same. We have the same behaviour. 2 is very unlikely, but 5 is more likely.

120
00:09:44,486 --> 00:09:48,570
Hence maybe we need to be more precise. Lets go to 2000 repetitions.

121
00:09:48,929 --> 00:09:51,310
and there we get this histogram.

122
00:09:51,929 --> 00:09:56,154
and then i want to repeat it again and again. To see that we are very much stable here.

123
00:09:56,971 --> 00:10:02,154
So what you should see here is, that for this example the highest probability is at 4.

124
00:10:02,354 --> 00:10:05,990
and the lowest is at 2. So we don't have a symmetric distribution.

125
00:10:06,686 --> 00:10:14,159
This is the case, because we take out a lot of balls compared to the number of balls of each kind inside the urn.

126
00:10:14,359 --> 00:10:17,486
Therefore i would suggest, play around with these numbers

127
00:10:17,487 --> 00:10:21,743
and compare the result with the binomial distribution, we have already discussed.

128
00:10:22,186 --> 00:10:26,555
Ok, then i think it's good enough for today and i hope i see you in the next video.

129
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:28,843
Have a nice day. Bye!

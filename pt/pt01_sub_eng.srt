Hello and welcome to probability theory.

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:07,240
A video series where we want to talk about stochastic problems.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,500
The making of this new course is only possible, because of very nice supporters on Steady and Paypal.

4
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:17,610
Therefore thank you very much and i hope you enjoy the videos.

5
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:22,600
And for the start i can tell you the goal of probability theory in general

6
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:27,970
is to formalize things like randomness and chances to get a mathematical theory.

7
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:33,130
So you see the topics here could be very applied, but it's still mathematics.

8
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:38,710
Also i can tell you there are a lot of different names this course could have alternatively.

9
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:44,270
For example we could call it Stochastic, stochastic processes or even statistics.

10
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:51,350
However, because i want to cover a lot of different topics here i stay with the very general probability theory.

11
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:57,350
To get an idea what to expect here i have some notions and topics in these boxes for you.

12
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:03,640
For example we will describe what a Probability measure or a Probability distribution really is.

13
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,700
So measure theory comes in.

14
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:12,460
Then random variables and random processes are needed to describe a lot of random experiments.

15
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:16,840
Also i think it's very important to prove the central limit theorem

16
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,640
and apply all our knowledge to statistical tests.

17
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:25,610
Ok i would say before diving into the whole theory let's look at a simple example.

18
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:31,220
So maybe not so surprising. Just let's throw a normal 6 sided die.

19
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,220
Then my question would be what is the probability of getting an even number

20
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:41,020
and then you should see the mathematics comes immediately in when we want to answer that

21
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:48,000
because we would say we have a set "A" that contains 3 elements namely 2, 4 and 6.

22
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,539
Maybe then you would say this is half the numbers of the die.

23
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:55,120
Therefore the probability should be 0.5

24
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:59,070
or in a formular P(A) = 0.5

25
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,970
Ok so this looks very nice and correct,

26
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:05,680
but still we don't know the mathematical meaning  of this "P" yet.

27
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:10,850
and also we have the questions what does this number mean here when i throw a die,

28
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:14,870
because one throw will get us exactly one outcome.

29
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:21,350
However you already know this probability. This number comes in when we have a lot of throws,

30
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:27,010
because then you can count all the throws that got an even number as an outcome

31
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:31,530
and then we can divide that by the number of all the throws we had

32
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:37,650
and then our overall feeling is that this number should converge to the number 0.5

33
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:42,720
So converging in some limit process where we increase the number of throws.

34
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:49,160
Hence one question would be does this work like a normal limit process we had in analysis for example.

35
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:53,540
and i can already tell you we will answer this in a later video.

36
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,230
Ok i think that's good enough for a short introduction here,

37
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:03,470
because i want to use the next few minutes to tell you that we will use the programming language "R" along the way.

38
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:07,900
I really think that this will be very helpful to understand probabilities,

39
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:11,250
because we can actually do some random experiments there.

40
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:15,630
For this reason please download and install RStudio

41
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:19,280
and then you should see this nice program here.

42
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:25,780
In this you should see these four empty windows where we can use the bottom left one immediately.

43
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:31,150
This is the R console where we can do immediately some basic calculations.

44
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:35,829
So you see our first output here is the number 5.

45
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:39,460
Indeed RStudio is not hard to use at all.

46
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:45,840
For example we can define variables and assign values for them by just using the equality sign.

47
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:51,810
and then it's very nice. All the assigned values we can see here in the top right window.

48
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:56,220
For defining a vector or a list we use the command "c".

49
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:00,970
then inside separated by commas we can put everything in.

50
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:03,300
But first let me increase the size here.

51
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:07,000
I put 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 in.

52
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:11,500
Hit enter and then you see we have defined the list i called die.

53
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:14,830
Also you see the values are listed here.

54
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,870
Indeed we can immediately simulate a throw of the die.

55
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:25,200
There we use the command "sample" where we put in die and we just want one throw.

56
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,700
Hitting enter gives us the outcome.

57
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:33,600
Now using the up arrow we can do it again and we get 4.

58
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:37,400
So you see here we have immediately a random experiment.

59
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,550
Obviously in our course about probability theory we will use that a lot.

60
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:47,470
Of course we will talk about a lot of other commands in "R" in other videos.

61
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:54,500
The last thing i should tell you here now is that you can use "?" before a command to get the manual.

62
00:04:55,170 --> 00:05:00,440
So ?sample gives you everything you need to know about this command sample.

63
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:04,690
Therefore i would say please play around with RStudio

64
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:08,660
and then we can use the next video to start with probability measures.

65
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:14,680
Ok then please use the comments to ask any questions and then i hope i see you in the next video.

66
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,910
Have a nice day. Bye!

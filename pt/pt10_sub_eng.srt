Hello and welcome back to probability theory.

2
00:00:04,243 --> 00:00:09,247
and as always first i want to thank all the nice people that support this channel on Steady or Paypal. 

3
00:00:09,657 --> 00:00:14,013
Now, in todays part 10 we will talk about so called random variables.

4
00:00:14,443 --> 00:00:19,114
First they might sound complicated, but actually they are very simple and natural.

5
00:00:19,857 --> 00:00:25,286
We just want to put all the relevant information of a random experiment into one object.

6
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:31,080
and usually for such objects we use capital letters. For example capital X.

7
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:39,273
Now soon we will see that this capital X is just a map defined on a sample space Omega with some special properties.

8
00:00:39,473 --> 00:00:44,808
Indeed often here the codomain is simply given by the real number lin R.

9
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:51,168
However in a moment i will show you how we can naturally generalize this to another set of values.

10
00:00:51,614 --> 00:00:56,143
and of course we will also discuss the properties we need for such a map.

11
00:00:56,343 --> 00:01:00,249
But before we do this lets first discuss a simple example.

12
00:01:01,343 --> 00:01:07,478
So what we could do is, as often, throwing 2 dice and maybe we have a red one and a green one.

13
00:01:07,914 --> 00:01:13,863
Hence we can distinguish the dice, which means this is the same as throwing one die twice.

14
00:01:14,414 --> 00:01:22,058
Therefore you should immediately be able to write down the probability space, because this is exactly what we discussed in the last video.

15
00:01:22,258 --> 00:01:30,249
So the sample space Omega is the cartesian product of 1 to 6 with itself and the sigma algebra A is just the power set.

16
00:01:30,449 --> 00:01:37,379
and then without writing down the explicit definition, we can simply say, P is given by the uniform distribution.

17
00:01:37,579 --> 00:01:44,533
Ok there you see, with this probability space we have the whole information of this random experiment.

18
00:01:44,733 --> 00:01:48,979
So all the possible outcomes with the probabilities are given here.

19
00:01:49,514 --> 00:01:56,267
However maybe we are in the situation where we are only interested in the sum of the two numbers the dice show.

20
00:01:56,771 --> 00:02:03,152
For example we could be in a game where this is important and the colours of the two dice don't matter at all.

21
00:02:03,629 --> 00:02:08,082
Then exactly in such a case we would define a random variable.

22
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:12,189
and as i told you before, we would simply call it X.

23
00:02:12,871 --> 00:02:20,771
Ok, so here we have a map from the sample space Omega, which has all the possible outcomes of the 2 dice, to the real numbers.

24
00:02:21,457 --> 00:02:26,176
So what X should do we already know. It should give us the sum of the 2 numbers.

25
00:02:26,643 --> 00:02:34,475
Hence a sample given by (omega_1, omega_2) is mapped to the sum omega_1 + omega_2.

26
00:02:34,675 --> 00:02:37,729
So you see, this is not a complicated map at all.

27
00:02:38,657 --> 00:02:44,535
What we can remember in this case is that the input is a sample and the output is a number.

28
00:02:44,735 --> 00:02:52,945
Ok, so this is a typical example of a random variable, where you see it's simply extracts the information we are interested in.

29
00:02:53,514 --> 00:02:57,136
Therefore later we will work with a lot of random variables.

30
00:02:57,743 --> 00:03:01,800
However first i would say we have to give the correct definition now.

31
00:03:02,471 --> 00:03:07,250
and as promised, this is the general definition one uses in probability theory.

32
00:03:07,614 --> 00:03:13,187
Ok, so what we need are 2 spaces we call measurable spaces or event spaces.

33
00:03:13,771 --> 00:03:19,657
The first one should be given by a set. A sample space Omega with a corresponding sigma algebra A

34
00:03:20,271 --> 00:03:26,075
and then the second one is given by a set Omega tilde with a corresponding sigma algebra A tilde.

35
00:03:26,657 --> 00:03:32,610
So you could say we have here probability spaces, where the probability measure P is not fixed yet.

36
00:03:33,157 --> 00:03:40,485
Hence we are just interested in the events, the elements of a sigma algebra and therefore we talk of events spaces.

37
00:03:40,685 --> 00:03:46,102
However in measure theory we would call these spaces measurable spaces

38
00:03:46,302 --> 00:03:51,756
and in fact the random variable we define now, we would call a measurable map.

39
00:03:51,956 --> 00:03:57,681
Nevertheless as often in probability theory, we use some special names for these objects.

40
00:03:57,881 --> 00:04:05,334
Ok, now we consider a map we call capital X from one sample space Omega into the other one, Omega tilde

41
00:04:05,757 --> 00:04:12,009
and then this map is called a random variable if it is a measurable map in the measure theoretical sense.

42
00:04:12,486 --> 00:04:18,519
Which means we have to look at all the pre-images of the events in the second sample space, Omega tilde.

43
00:04:18,886 --> 00:04:24,141
Here lets denote an element of curved A tilde, just with a normal A tilde.

44
00:04:24,629 --> 00:04:29,491
and then we know, this pre-image of A tilde is the subset of Omega.

45
00:04:29,691 --> 00:04:35,971
However in the end, when we have a probability measure P we want to measure these sets here.

46
00:04:36,529 --> 00:04:43,536
Hence it's necessary that this is not just a subset of Omega, but also an element of the sigma algebra A.

47
00:04:43,736 --> 00:04:49,425
Therefore this is exactly the right condition we need here for all A tilde.

48
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:54,065
OK, there we have it. This is the whole definition of a random variable.

49
00:04:54,114 --> 00:04:56,141
A concept we will need a lot.

50
00:04:56,341 --> 00:05:00,011
Therefore i would say lets immediately look at some examples.

51
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:05,057
So maybe for the start lets discuss the details of the random variable from above.

52
00:05:05,607 --> 00:05:09,329
There the first event space was given by (Omega, A).

53
00:05:09,529 --> 00:05:15,386
Where Omega is the sample space given by 1 to 6, squared and A is just the power set.

54
00:05:15,943 --> 00:05:20,244
Moreover the second event space was given by the real number line.

55
00:05:20,929 --> 00:05:23,486
Hence this would be Omega tilde.

56
00:05:24,192 --> 00:05:27,812
However now we should ask: What is A tilde?

57
00:05:28,257 --> 00:05:31,657
In the end i can already tell you it will not matter at all,

58
00:05:31,857 --> 00:05:36,543
but usually when we have the real number line, we would take the Borel sigma algebra.

59
00:05:37,057 --> 00:05:39,743
Therefore we also do this here

60
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:47,103
and now i can ask you: is this map from before, this X, actually a random variable?

61
00:05:47,729 --> 00:05:53,886
At first glance it seems to be that we have to check a lot, because we need to check all the pre-images here.

62
00:05:54,386 --> 00:05:59,253
However please recall the sigma algebra A here is the whole power set.

63
00:05:59,886 --> 00:06:08,586
Hence the condition we have to satisfy just tells us that the pre-image of any Borel set A tilde is a subset of Omega.

64
00:06:09,025 --> 00:06:11,714
Which is of course trivially fulfilled.

65
00:06:12,167 --> 00:06:19,866
This means that the definition of X does not matter at all, when we have on the left hand side the whole power set as the sigma algebra.

66
00:06:20,371 --> 00:06:25,232
So in this case we can easily conclude that the map X is a random variable.

67
00:06:25,432 --> 00:06:30,740
Indeed most of the time we won't have any problems at all fulfilling this condition here

68
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:35,463
or to put it in other words counter examples are always very artificial.

69
00:06:35,829 --> 00:06:43,822
For example you could take the same case again, but now we will change the power set here. So we take another sigma algebra A.

70
00:06:44,022 --> 00:06:48,100
Hence instead of the largest one, the power set, we take the smallest one.

71
00:06:49,057 --> 00:06:54,294
So the only events we have in our sigma algebra A are the empty set and Omega itself.

72
00:06:55,229 --> 00:07:01,386
When of course we immediately find a counter example. You just have to look at the pre-image of the singleton 2.

73
00:07:01,986 --> 00:07:06,820
In words this means the sum of the 2 numbers of the dice is exactly 2.

74
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:11,944
So there is only one dice throw possible. The 2 dice show both one.

75
00:07:12,271 --> 00:07:16,681
Therefore this pre-image is just a set with only one element.

76
00:07:17,257 --> 00:07:21,489
and that's the reason i chose 2 here, because then i don't have to write so much

77
00:07:21,689 --> 00:07:23,801
and of course you immediately see the result.

78
00:07:24,001 --> 00:07:28,498
This set is neither the empty set nor the whole set Omega.

79
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:32,583
So it's not an element in the sigma algebra A.

80
00:07:32,783 --> 00:07:37,272
and then we can conclude, in this case X is not a random variable.

81
00:07:37,986 --> 00:07:43,479
Ok, now in summary what you should see here is: random variables are not complicated at all.

82
00:07:43,814 --> 00:07:48,811
and indeed most of the time the fact that we have a random variable is immediately given.

83
00:07:49,011 --> 00:07:53,030
Ok now i want to close this video with an important notation.

84
00:07:53,614 --> 00:07:58,741
Assume again, that we have 2 measurable spaces also called event spaces.

85
00:07:59,257 --> 00:08:01,829
Moreover lets also fix two other things.

86
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:05,329
First we have a random variable X as before

87
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:09,519
and secondly maybe not so surprising, we have a probability measure P.

88
00:08:09,719 --> 00:08:13,036
Defined on the first event space on the left.

89
00:08:13,236 --> 00:08:18,461
This means when we take any set A tilde from the sigma algebra A tilde

90
00:08:18,661 --> 00:08:23,931
and look at the pre-image under X, then we can calculate the probability of this event.

91
00:08:24,486 --> 00:08:31,326
Simply because we know by the definition of a random variable that this set lies in the sigma algebra A.

92
00:08:32,071 --> 00:08:34,867
Hence P of this set makes sense.

93
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:39,571
Therefore one usually uses a shorter, but strange notation for this.

94
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:44,849
One simply writes P of X in A tilde.

95
00:08:45,429 --> 00:08:50,563
First it looks a little bit odd, but you will see this a lot in probability theory

96
00:08:51,071 --> 00:08:55,714
and indeed it makes a little bit more sense when we use the definition of a pre-image.

97
00:08:56,057 --> 00:09:00,344
Which is simply the set of all lower case omega in capital Omega

98
00:09:01,029 --> 00:09:05,491
with the property that X of lower case omega lies in A tilde.

99
00:09:06,043 --> 00:09:11,309
Hence you can see the left hand side as a shortcut for writing this whole set.

100
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:19,076
The important thing you should remember here is that this literally does not make sense, but it stands for a whole set in Omega.

101
00:09:19,276 --> 00:09:24,193
Please note in the same sense also other shortcuts as this are used as well.

102
00:09:24,686 --> 00:09:28,149
In more detail we will discuss this in the next video.

103
00:09:28,349 --> 00:09:32,043
Therefore i hope i see there and have a nice day. Bye!

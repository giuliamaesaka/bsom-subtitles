00:00:00,371 --> 00:00:03,455
Hello and welcome back to probability theory.

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:09,807
and as always the first thing i want to do is to thank all the nice people that support this channel on Steady or Paypal.

3
00:00:10,007 --> 00:00:14,186
Today in part 9 we will talk about the important concept of independence.

4
00:00:14,729 --> 00:00:18,363
More precisely this video is about the independence for events.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,105
For this please recall we can visualize events as subsets in the sample space, Omega.

6
00:00:24,305 --> 00:00:27,835
So here you see an event A and an event B.

7
00:00:28,035 --> 00:00:33,040
Now, in some sense independence should mean, that the 2 events don't affect each other.

8
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:38,572
Whatever this means, in this example it's not clear at all, because we have an intersection.

9
00:00:39,043 --> 00:00:42,174
Therefore lets first look at a simpler example.

10
00:00:42,614 --> 00:00:46,178
So here we have 2 sets that are clearly disjoint.

11
00:00:46,378 --> 00:00:51,457
Hence they don't have to do anything with each other. So we call them mutually exclusive.

12
00:00:51,657 --> 00:00:55,701
However the question is: would we also call them independent?

13
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:01,794
In general we won't do that and in order to see this we have to think of probabilities.

14
00:01:02,214 --> 00:01:08,714
Namely, when we calculate the probability that A occurs under the condition that B occurs,

15
00:01:09,343 --> 00:01:12,421
then this should be the probability of A itself.

16
00:01:12,843 --> 00:01:17,349
In other words the event B should not effect the probability of A.

17
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:23,914
So please remember: independence should mean that the knowledge of B does not make A less or more likely.

18
00:01:24,629 --> 00:01:28,093
and of course this should also holds the other way around.

19
00:01:28,757 --> 00:01:34,212
So the conditional probability of B under A should be the same as the probability of B.

20
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:41,643
Now looking at the examples we see it's not fulfilled for the second example and not clear at all for the first example.

21
00:01:42,029 --> 00:01:48,295
For this please recall, the conditional probability here means: what is the ratio of A inside B?

22
00:01:48,686 --> 00:01:53,756
And then the property tells us: it should be the same as the ratio of A inside Omega.

23
00:01:54,071 --> 00:01:57,951
and then of course, we also have to check this equality for B.

24
00:01:58,151 --> 00:02:03,376
Therefore i would say lets visualize this in an example, where we have some numbers to work with.

25
00:02:03,943 --> 00:02:07,567
So as before we have a sample space Omega and 2 events.

26
00:02:07,767 --> 00:02:11,293
and maybe lets choose 1/2 of Omega to be the set A.

27
00:02:11,493 --> 00:02:17,651
Of course, please recall this is only the visualization for the probability of A being 1/2.

28
00:02:17,851 --> 00:02:23,135
This means that we measure the sizes of the sets in the picture with the probability measure P.

29
00:02:23,335 --> 00:02:28,149
and now our idea is that we also split Omega in half with the set B.

30
00:02:28,557 --> 00:02:32,329
Hence the probability of B should also be 1/2.

31
00:02:32,529 --> 00:02:37,480
However, now the important question is: what can we say about the conditional probabilities?

32
00:02:37,829 --> 00:02:41,214
So first what is the ratio of A in B?

33
00:02:41,471 --> 00:02:45,384
and of course in the picture you immediately see it's also 1/2.

34
00:02:45,584 --> 00:02:49,943
and on the other hand we ask: what is the ratio of B in A?

35
00:02:50,143 --> 00:02:53,680
and in this case we see it's the same number, it's 1/2.

36
00:02:54,171 --> 00:02:58,589
Hence indeed we have the equalities here, so the events are independent.

37
00:02:59,143 --> 00:03:04,070
Ok, i think we have seen enough visualizations and we can start formulating the definition.

38
00:03:04,571 --> 00:03:08,579
and for this it's helpful to recall the definition of the conditional probability.

39
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:15,729
So P(A|B) was given as P of the intersection divided by P(B).

40
00:03:16,243 --> 00:03:21,552
and similarly P(B|A) is given by the intersection divided by P(A).

41
00:03:22,043 --> 00:03:24,381
Now, for the independence we want 2 things.

42
00:03:24,581 --> 00:03:30,515
First this conditional probability should be equal to P(A) and this one should be equal to P(B).

43
00:03:30,715 --> 00:03:37,488
and there you should see, if we multiply this denominator to the other side, we have the same equality.

44
00:03:38,014 --> 00:03:41,304
Namely the intersection is given by the product.

45
00:03:41,504 --> 00:03:45,645
and this is now what we can choose as a defining property for independence.

46
00:03:45,845 --> 00:03:48,515
So it's short and easy to remember.

47
00:03:48,715 --> 00:03:51,946
Ok, then lets put this into a definition.

48
00:03:52,429 --> 00:03:55,786
So the framework is the same as always. We have a probability space.

49
00:03:55,829 --> 00:04:00,314
Which means a sample space Omega, a sigma Algebra A and the probability measure P.

50
00:04:00,871 --> 00:04:07,343
and now we have learned, we call 2 events A, B from the sigma Algebra independent if this equality holds.

51
00:04:07,929 --> 00:04:12,815
Then with this it turns out, we don't have to restrict ourself to 2 events.

52
00:04:13,015 --> 00:04:16,689
We can just consider a whole family of events A_i.

53
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:21,543
and indeed we could have infinitely many when this index set "i" is infinite.

54
00:04:21,991 --> 00:04:28,139
and then also here the whole family is called independent if it sends the intersection to a product.

55
00:04:28,339 --> 00:04:34,466
More concretely we have P of this big intersection is equal to the product of the single probabilities.

56
00:04:34,786 --> 00:04:39,741
and this should hold no matter which finite subset of the index set "i" we choose.

57
00:04:40,371 --> 00:04:44,399
In other words in this formula here only finitely many sets A_j go in.

58
00:04:44,886 --> 00:04:48,667
However you also see we need to check all possibilities here.

59
00:04:48,971 --> 00:04:52,176
Maybe the only thing you can ignore would be the empty set.

60
00:04:52,586 --> 00:04:56,374
Ok, then lets look what this means for a real world example.

61
00:04:56,829 --> 00:05:00,470
So lets take an ordinary die and lets throw it 2 times.

62
00:05:01,043 --> 00:05:05,429
and then we look at the outcome with order. So we have a first throw and a second throw.

63
00:05:06,129 --> 00:05:09,571
Hence our whole probability space has to represent this.

64
00:05:09,824 --> 00:05:15,198
So for the sample space Omega we have the cartesian product of the set 1 to 6 with itself.

65
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:21,801
Then in the next step for the sigma Algebra as always in the discrete case, we just have the power set of Omega.

66
00:05:22,001 --> 00:05:27,386
and finally for the probability measure P we have something we call the uniform distribution.

67
00:05:27,771 --> 00:05:33,718
This is not complicated at all, it just tells us that every element in Omega gets the same probability.

68
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:37,900
Or to put it in other words. The probability mass function is constant.

69
00:05:38,443 --> 00:05:43,587
So in our case we have 36 elements in Omega. So we need 1 over 36.

70
00:05:43,787 --> 00:05:48,362
Ok so this is the probability space and now we can look at some events.

71
00:05:48,562 --> 00:05:52,815
In the first step i would suggest lets describe the events with words.

72
00:05:53,015 --> 00:05:58,262
"A" should be the event that the first throw shows a 6 and the second throw can show anything.

73
00:05:58,462 --> 00:06:04,251
On the other hand B should be the event where we look at both throws and the sum of the numbers is 7.

74
00:06:04,451 --> 00:06:08,985
Ok, then in the next step lets translate these descriptions into sets.

75
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:15,131
For the first one we just have a sample omega_1, omega_2, where omega_1 is equal to 6.

76
00:06:15,629 --> 00:06:23,665
Then for the set B, we also have the set of all samples omega_1, omega_2. Where omega_1 + omega_2 should be 7.

77
00:06:24,229 --> 00:06:28,130
Ok since the sets are defined we can calculate the probabilities.

78
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:33,419
Of course without much thinking we immediately get the probability for A, as 1 over 6.

79
00:06:33,619 --> 00:06:40,664
But you can also calculate it when you see we have 6 elements in this set. So we have 6 divided by 36.

80
00:06:40,864 --> 00:06:45,026
The same thing we can do for B, because we can list all the elements.

81
00:06:45,226 --> 00:06:50,011
So we could start with the element, where the first throw is 1 and the second 6.

82
00:06:50,211 --> 00:06:54,466
Then in the same way, if the first throw is 2 the second has to be 5.

83
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:57,970
and in this order we get all the possibilities.

84
00:06:58,271 --> 00:07:02,323
and we count 6. So we have also 6 divided by 36.

85
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:08,199
So both events have the same probability, but this does not mean that they are independent.

86
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:12,891
However now using the definition we can just check if they are independent.

87
00:07:13,329 --> 00:07:17,007
So lets simply calculate the probability of the intersection.

88
00:07:17,207 --> 00:07:22,686
So from all the elements in B we have to take the ones that have a 6 at the first throw.

89
00:07:23,186 --> 00:07:25,536
and you see we only find 1.

90
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:28,943
Hence the probability is 1 over 36.

91
00:07:29,343 --> 00:07:33,553
Which is in fact the same as the product P(A) times P(B).

92
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:37,636
Therefore our 2 events A and B are independent.

93
00:07:38,257 --> 00:07:42,439
Ok maybe it's a good idea to look also at a continuous example.

94
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,977
So here we take the unit interval and throw a point into it.

95
00:07:47,243 --> 00:07:51,731
Indeed this is a typical and simple absolutely continuous example.

96
00:07:51,986 --> 00:07:55,477
and i think you already know how to choose the probability space.

97
00:07:55,677 --> 00:07:59,349
Of course the sample space Omega should be the unit interval.

98
00:07:59,714 --> 00:08:02,719
and the sigma algebra is the Borel sigma algebra.

99
00:08:03,243 --> 00:08:07,317
Finally the probability measure we also call the uniform distribution.

100
00:08:07,517 --> 00:08:15,277
However now we have it in the continuous case, which means instead of a probability mass function we have a probability density function.

101
00:08:15,477 --> 00:08:19,483
Hence this uniform now means, we have a constant density function.

102
00:08:19,683 --> 00:08:23,680
and here because we have the unit interval, we have the constant 1.

103
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:32,961
As a reminder this means when we want to measure the probability of an interval [a,b], we have the integral over this interval of the density function.

104
00:08:33,343 --> 00:08:36,049
Which should be "b-a".

105
00:08:36,471 --> 00:08:42,654
However of course this only makes sense if we choose b greater than "a" and a,b in Omega.

106
00:08:42,854 --> 00:08:48,225
I say this because often you see that the whole real number line is taken as the sample space

107
00:08:48,425 --> 00:08:53,170
and then of course in order to have the same thing, we have to change the density function.

108
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:58,339
Indeed this is what we then call the indicator function of the unit interval.

109
00:08:58,539 --> 00:09:02,194
It's written as such a 1, where a set is in the index.

110
00:09:02,394 --> 00:09:06,954
The definition is very simple. We only have 2 values, either 1 or 0.

111
00:09:07,154 --> 00:09:13,248
and the important thing is: for all elements in this set here, so the unit interval we are at 1.

112
00:09:13,448 --> 00:09:15,733
and otherwise we get out 0.

113
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:21,373
Now in the case that the function is defined on the whole real number line, the graph looks like this.

114
00:09:21,573 --> 00:09:24,614
So we have one jump at 0 and one at 1.

115
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:31,220
So you see, taking this as the density function, the sample space R would also work.

116
00:09:31,257 --> 00:09:35,486
However this is just a side note, lets get back to our problem of independence.

117
00:09:35,686 --> 00:09:39,231
So lets take 2 independent events A and B.

118
00:09:39,431 --> 00:09:43,357
Then we now by definition that the probabilities fulfill this equality.

119
00:09:43,629 --> 00:09:47,257
Now lets use our probability measure and write the integral.

120
00:09:47,586 --> 00:09:53,829
So we have the intersection A,B as the region we integrate over and the indicator function inside.

121
00:09:54,029 --> 00:09:58,906
Here a nice property of the integral we can use is that we can exchange the sets.

122
00:09:59,106 --> 00:10:02,766
So we have the indicator function of the set A intersected with B now

123
00:10:02,786 --> 00:10:05,641
and [0,1] is the region we integrate over.

124
00:10:06,343 --> 00:10:10,259
If you know the definition of the integral, you immediately see that this is correct.

125
00:10:10,459 --> 00:10:14,007
For probability theory this is something we can use a lot.

126
00:10:14,207 --> 00:10:17,481
For example we can also use it here on the right hand side.

127
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:21,369
So first lets fill in the definition of the probabilities here.

128
00:10:22,014 --> 00:10:25,152
and then as before we can simply exchange the roles.

129
00:10:25,643 --> 00:10:29,157
So what we get here is an equality of integrals.

130
00:10:29,473 --> 00:10:34,936
This integral here on the left hand side with the intersection goes to a product of 2 integrals.

131
00:10:35,136 --> 00:10:39,464
However, please recall we really need the independence to have this.

132
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:44,125
So with this you see independence can be very useful in calculations.

133
00:10:44,325 --> 00:10:47,204
and of course we will use that in later videos.

134
00:10:47,543 --> 00:10:52,243
Therefore i really hope i see you in the next video about probability theory.

135
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:54,614
Have a nice day and Bye!

Hello and welcome back to probability theory

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:08,880
And first i want to thank all the nice people that support this channel on Steady or Paypal.

3
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:13,510
Now in todays part 2 we will talk about probability measures.

4
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:18,280
Of course this will be a notion that will be important through the whole series

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,380
because we can put the whole randomness we want to describe into such a probability measure.

6
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:29,840
Now if you already know some measure theory you also already know what probability measures are.

7
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:35,300
Indeed in short you can just say these are the measure with total mass 1.

8
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,840
However of course i want to explain a little bit more about this here.

9
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:45,300
Maybe a good starting point is always to think of a rectangle
or a square in the plane.

10
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:50,310
This is the overall set we consider and usually we call it omega

11
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:56,580
and also you should know in probability theory this is usually known as the sample space.

12
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:04,849
Therefore this omega could be any set, because we just put all possible outcomes of our random experiment into it.

13
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:11,330
and then we just visualize this set with the rectangle here where the whole area should be 1.

14
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:15,830
Simply because the probability to get any outcome should be 1.

15
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:22,510
And now a probability measure should also tell you the probability for a given subset.

16
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,370
So what we want here is simply a map we call "P".

17
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:29,970
That maps subsets to numbers.

18
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:34,550
Hence this curved "A" here should be a collection of subsets.

19
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:41,780
In other words the best case scenario would be that we have all the subsets of omega in this fancy "A".

20
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:49,160
Ok, now for getting a useful probability notion here
we really have some important requirements for this map.

21
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:55,370
The first thing we already said. We want That the probability of the whole sample space should be 1.

22
00:01:56,290 --> 00:02:01,140
So when we measure probabilities the maximum value we want to get out should be 1.

23
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:05,140
On the other hand the minimal value should be 0.

24
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:12,210
Therefore no matter which subset "A" we put in we always want to get out a number between 0 and 1.

25
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:15,770
Hence we have the closed 0,1 interval here.

26
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:22,360
Going back to our rectangle here this means the smallest area we could measure should be 0.

27
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:27,850
However all other values between 0 and 1 could be possible for areas.

28
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:32,300
Ok then in the next step let's look at another subset "B" here.

29
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:38,610
Now if there's no overlap between both sets "A" and "B" we could simply add the areas.

30
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:47,550
This means that the probability of the subset "A union B"  should be just the sum of both probabilities.

31
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:53,450
So we want this nice and natural formula in the case  that "A" and "B" are disjoint.

32
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:58,890
As a reminder this means that the intersection of both subsets should be the empty set.

33
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:03,390
Speaking of the empty set. What should be the area of the empty set?

34
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,980
Of course the only useful definition should be to choose it as zero.

35
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:12,980
So the probability to get no outcome at all should always be 0.

36
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:18,620
Ok, now we have almost everything we need here.
There is only one thing missing.

37
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,190
Namely this formula should also hold in a limit process.

38
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:27,360
This means that we look here at a countable union of subsets.

39
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:34,360
In our picture this would mean that we approximate an area by adding up countable many areas.

40
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:39,340
Hence in our formula we will have a series from one to infinity.

41
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:42,410
So this union goes to a sum.

42
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:48,070
Of course for this formula we also need the assumption that we have a disjoint union here.

43
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:53,120
In other words you would say the family "A_j" is pairwise disjoint.

44
00:03:53,730 --> 00:04:00,530
This means that no matter which two different sets "A_i" and "A_j" you choose you always have an empty intersection.

45
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:07,600
So with this we have the requirements we demand when we want to define a general notion of a probability.

46
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:14,200
Now to satisfy these claims here we need for the domain "A" a so called sigma-algebra.

47
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:18,660
Therefore lets talk about the definition of a sigma-algebra.

48
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:26,720
I don't want to go into the details, because i have a whole series about measure theory, where the first videos are about sigma-algebras.

49
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,580
The overall idea is the same. For any set omega

50
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:33,530
we only want to consider suitable subsets.

51
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:37,409
However these subsets together should fulfill some rules.

52
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:42,120
So we take a collection of subsets denoted with this curved "A"

53
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,010
Which means we have a subset of the power set of omega.

54
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:53,460
Now thinking of a probability problem in this curved "A" we have all the events we want the probability for.

55
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:59,380
For example for the throw of a die we have the event of getting 
an even number as an outcome

56
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:03,930
and this event is a subset of which we want to measure the probability.

57
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:08,850
Therefore in this case we need that event to be an element of this "A" here.

58
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:16,570
However what we always want to do is to measure the probability of the empty set and the whole sample space omega.

59
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:20,120
Hence both sets should be an element of "A".

60
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:27,000
Then the next property we need is, if we take any subset "A" that lies in our curved "A"

61
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:30,050
then the complement should also be in curved "A".

62
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:35,620
The complement in general is defined as omega, the whole space, without the set "A"

63
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:38,630
and i always denote it with this upper index "c".

64
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:43,930
Please note this makes sense, because if we have the probability for one event "A"

65
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:48,240
then we should also be able to calculate the probability of not "A".

66
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:55,650
Ok and then the third property is not so hard to understand, because you already know we want this for the probability measure.

67
00:05:56,390 --> 00:06:03,830
So we just take countable many sets from "A" and then the whole union should also be an element of "A".

68
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,820
Now having these three properties the collection "A" is called a sigma algebra

69
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:14,450
and usually we will write it in this way with a lowercase sigma.

70
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:22,630
Also important to note here is that the elements of a sigma algebra in probability theory are usually called events.

71
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:31,030
Ok now such a sigma algebra is as i told you before the domain for such a probability measure we now define.

72
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:36,300
Therefore lets fix a sample space omega and a sigma algebra "A".

73
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:43,630
Then a map we now call "P" with domain "A" and codomain the interval [0,1]

74
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:48,140
is called a probability measure if it fulfills two properties

75
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:52,810
and because we have already discussed them above we can just copy them now.

76
00:06:53,340 --> 00:07:00,310
The first one is simply that the probability of the whole space is 1 and the probability of the empty event is 0.

77
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:04,470
And the second one is what we call sigma additivity.

78
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:09,890
And please remember for this sigma additivity
we need pairwise disjoint sets.

79
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:17,720
Ok and with this you know the general notion of a probability measure and of course we will use that a lot here.

80
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:21,460
However maybe lets start with a simple example.

81
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:25,410
I would say lets look a the die from last video again.

82
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:30,480
So if we just throw it one time we immediately know the sample space omega.

83
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:35,200
All possible outcomes from 1 to 6 form our sample space.

84
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:39,680
However now for the sigma algebra "A" you already have the choice.

85
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:43,930
The questions here is in how many events could you be interested.

86
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:49,520
The simple answer would be we are interested in all events.
Therefore we choose the power set.

87
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:57,030
Often i would say this is a useful approach. 
However it won't work in the case that the sample space is infinite,

88
00:07:57,390 --> 00:08:01,800
but also there one could simply say i choose a large enough sigma algebra

89
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:06,420
and then we define the probability measure on this sigma algebra.

90
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:12,910
In our case, because we have an ordinary die we have that each side has the same probability.

91
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:21,300
Therefore in our general definition here this would mean that we count the elements of "A" and devide by the elements of omega.

92
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:26,460
Of course in this case this would mean in the denominator we have the number 6.

93
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:34,010
For example if we want to calculate the probability of the event of throwing a 2 we get out 1 over 6.

94
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:40,770
On the other hand the probability of the event of throwing an even number is 3 divided by 6

95
00:08:41,299 --> 00:08:42,970
or in other words one half.

96
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:49,520
Ok and now here you see this is our mathematical model of
throwing one ordinary die

97
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:56,800
and in later videos you will see we can easily expand this whole model to cover also other examples.

98
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:02,620
Ok now for closing this video i give you a small exercise about probability measures.

99
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:08,110
Try to prove that for a general probability measure "P" and an event "A"

100
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:13,340
the probability of the complement is 1 minus the probability of "A".

101
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:19,280
So this is a very nice property that immediately comes out of the two other properties here.

102
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,300
Ok i think that's good enough for today in the next videos we will cover a lot of other examples of probability measures.

103
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,520
Therefore i hope i see you there and have a nice day. 
Bye!

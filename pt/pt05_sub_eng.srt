00:00:00,371 --> 00:00:03,487
Hello and welcome back to probability theory.

2
00:00:03,857 --> 00:00:08,940
and as always, first i want to thank all the nice people that support this channel on Steady or Paypal.

3
00:00:09,671 --> 00:00:13,558
and in todays part 5 we will talk about the so called product case.

4
00:00:14,114 --> 00:00:20,343
More precisely we will talk about product spaces, product sigma algebras and product probability measures.

5
00:00:20,585 --> 00:00:26,831
Now before we can define this product case, we first have to talk about the definition of a probability space.

6
00:00:27,143 --> 00:00:31,769
Indeed this is not so complicated, because we already have all we need for this.

7
00:00:32,029 --> 00:00:38,043
We just need a sample space Omega, a sigma algebra "A" and a probability measure "P".

8
00:00:38,386 --> 00:00:43,505
Of course they all should fit together, which means the sigma algebra is a sigma algebra for Omega.

9
00:00:44,014 --> 00:00:48,096
and also the probability measure is defined on the sigma algebra.

10
00:00:48,586 --> 00:00:54,435
Then in this case all these 3 things together, which we call a triple, is called a probability space.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,780
So the meaning here is, we have an abstract space, where we can calculate with probabilities.

12
00:01:00,243 --> 00:01:04,586
Now the product case occurs when we want to combine multiple probability spaces.

13
00:01:05,086 --> 00:01:08,452
In this case we can simply introduce an index "n".

14
00:01:08,786 --> 00:01:14,371
Depending on the context here we could have 2, 3 or even infinitely many probability spaces.

15
00:01:15,014 --> 00:01:20,212
However i want to stay at countable many, so we choose the natural numbers as the index set.

16
00:01:20,643 --> 00:01:25,886
Now this whole idea seems very so i would suggest that we first look at an example.

17
00:01:26,257 --> 00:01:30,220
To keep it simple lets combine two random experiments we already know.

18
00:01:30,571 --> 00:01:34,634
First lets take a discrete case, where we just look at the throw of a die.

19
00:01:35,243 --> 00:01:39,877
and then lets do a continuous case, where we throw a point into this interval.

20
00:01:40,543 --> 00:01:43,530
In other words here we have an one dimentional dart game.

21
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:47,410
and we can hit real numbers between -1 and 1.

22
00:01:47,829 --> 00:01:54,070
Now because we have an order here, we first do the one experiment, then the other, our outcome would be a tuple.

23
00:01:54,071 --> 00:01:57,121
Which is in this case is just a pair of two numbers.

24
00:01:57,729 --> 00:02:01,206
For example 3, 0.25 would be a possible outcome. 

25
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:06,704
Now the overall question would be how can we calculate probabilities in this scenario

26
00:02:07,343 --> 00:02:12,082
In order to answer this we first have to write down the corresponding probability spaces. 

27
00:02:12,514 --> 00:02:15,982
Now for the first probability space we take the index 1.

28
00:02:16,443 --> 00:02:22,066
Of course we already know for throwing a die the corresponding sample space would be the numbers 1 to 6.

29
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:26,173
and then the sigma algebra can be chosen as the power set.

30
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,468
Moreover we also know what the probability measure "P_1" should be in this case.

31
00:02:31,929 --> 00:02:35,634
The probability mass function is just given by 1 over 6.

32
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:40,346
Now in the same way we can also say what the second probability space should be.

33
00:02:40,786 --> 00:02:43,539
Of course here lets take the index 2.

34
00:02:43,943 --> 00:02:49,252
Of course now we already know the sample space should be the full intervall from -1 to 1.

35
00:02:49,729 --> 00:02:53,964
and consequently in the continuous case we have the Borel sigma algebra.

36
00:02:54,586 --> 00:02:58,510
and then the probability measure "P_2" can be written as an integral.

37
00:02:59,114 --> 00:03:02,745
Where the probability density function is given by 0.5.

38
00:03:03,186 --> 00:03:08,661
Ok the only thing we have to do now is to combine both probability spaces into a new one..

39
00:03:09,271 --> 00:03:16,344
Since you already know, the possible outcomes are given by pairs, we know that the new sample space should be the cartesian product.

40
00:03:16,671 --> 00:03:22,532
This means that in an abstract sense, we have Omega_1 on the x-axis and Omega_2 on the y-axis.

41
00:03:22,957 --> 00:03:28,914
and now possible events where we want to measure probabilities are just given by subsets in this plane.

42
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,919
Therefore we already know what the new probability space should be.

43
00:03:33,486 --> 00:03:36,924
First the sample space should be given by this cartesian product.

44
00:03:37,671 --> 00:03:41,511
This means that we have an order here. First we throw the die and then the dart. 

45
00:03:42,429 --> 00:03:47,146
and now the sigma algebra we need here is what we usually call the product sigma algebra.

46
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:51,962
To define this we take the cartesian product of the two sigma algebras and then say 

47
00:03:52,162 --> 00:03:55,213
use the sigma algebra that is generated by this set.

48
00:03:55,843 --> 00:04:00,774
Maybe we shouldn't focus here on the sigma algebra, because it can distract from the overall idea.

49
00:04:01,486 --> 00:04:04,396
However later i will tell you a little bit more about this construction.

50
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:10,202
If you want to know more details you can look at my measure theory series. It's part 17.

51
00:04:10,986 --> 00:04:15,597
There i also explained how we can define the probability measure, we just call "P" now.

52
00:04:16,171 --> 00:04:20,586
It's a well defined probability measure and we just call it the product measure.

53
00:04:20,991 --> 00:04:27,267
For us now it's not important to know the whole construction, but only one important property this measure has.

54
00:04:27,843 --> 00:04:35,540
For this lets look at two events. The first we call "A_1" from the first sigma algebra and the other one "A_2" from the second sigma algebra.

55
00:04:35,971 --> 00:04:41,686
and then we want to calculate the probability of the cartesian product, which is a subset in the plane here.

56
00:04:42,429 --> 00:04:49,192
Now, the nice property of the product measure is that this is exactly the product of the two single probabilities.

57
00:04:49,486 --> 00:04:55,106
This means, if we know these two probabilities, we can immediately calculate this probability.

58
00:04:55,414 --> 00:04:58,373
Hence lets look what we get in our example here.

59
00:04:58,957 --> 00:05:03,171
Here i want to caluclate the probability that we first throw a 2 or a 3

60
00:05:03,686 --> 00:05:05,043
Of course with the die.

61
00:05:05,089 --> 00:05:08,171
and then with the dart we want to hit the first half.

62
00:05:08,871 --> 00:05:12,280
Hence the event we want to measure is this cartesian product.

63
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,223
and by our formula for our product measure this is simply this product.

64
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:21,657
Hence first we use "P_1" here and then "P_2".

65
00:05:22,034 --> 00:05:26,142
and it's not hart to see that we first have "1/3" times 0.5.

66
00:05:26,757 --> 00:05:30,745
So the probability of this event is exactly 1 over 6.

67
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:38,171
Ok, so what you should see with this example is that the product case is very natural and also very important for calculations.

68
00:05:38,757 --> 00:05:41,749
Therefore now lets write down the general definition.

69
00:05:42,457 --> 00:05:46,663
Instead of two we now look at infinitely many probability spaces.

70
00:05:47,114 --> 00:05:51,391
Lets denote them as before, where we choose the index set as the natural numbers.

71
00:05:52,057 --> 00:05:56,596
To define the product space we use the same symbols, but now without an index. 

72
00:05:56,957 --> 00:06:00,671
At this point we already have a rough idea, what this space should be.

73
00:06:01,014 --> 00:06:06,127
The sample space Omega is just the cartesian product as before, but now an infinite one.

74
00:06:06,829 --> 00:06:09,966
Indeed one often denotes that with a product sign.

75
00:06:10,457 --> 00:06:17,357
Now the important thing to note here is that elements of this sample space, are not just tuples now, but sequences.

76
00:06:17,971 --> 00:06:24,066
and they have the property, like in this example, the lower case Omega_3 comes from the sample space Omega_3.

77
00:06:24,729 --> 00:06:27,729
So you see the sample space is not complicated at all.

78
00:06:28,329 --> 00:06:32,271
However the sigma algebra "A" is much harder to write down.

79
00:06:32,574 --> 00:06:36,650
Usually we just say in short it's generated by cylinder sets.

80
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,871
and in this case we denote that as before with a sigma at front.

81
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:46,936
Now the idea here is that we first consider special subsets of this infinite cartesian product.

82
00:06:47,429 --> 00:06:52,610
Namely they look like this. Where we have the whole space, where we only change one sample space.

83
00:06:53,229 --> 00:06:56,544
So infinitely many are still at Omega_j.

84
00:06:57,157 --> 00:07:00,854
Indeed this is the important thing. So this would be another example.

85
00:07:01,571 --> 00:07:06,239
and then we look at the smallest sigma algebra that contains all these subsets.

86
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,299
and with this we have the thing, we call the product sigma algebra.

87
00:07:10,829 --> 00:07:15,704
So you see it's just a generalisation of the part we had before with only two factors.

88
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:18,935
and exactly the same holds for the product measure.

89
00:07:19,514 --> 00:07:23,533
Here please recall, we want to be able to measure probabilities like this one.

90
00:07:24,186 --> 00:07:27,500
However now in our case we have an infinite cartesian product.

91
00:07:28,129 --> 00:07:33,844
For the cylinder sets we already discussed the idea, that we only want to change finitely many sets here.

92
00:07:34,786 --> 00:07:39,682
This means that after we reach the index "m" only Omegas will follow.

93
00:07:40,114 --> 00:07:44,148
We do this, because in this case we have a similar formula as before.

94
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:48,115
We have the finite product of the single probabilities.

95
00:07:48,529 --> 00:07:53,741
This is important, because as before it means we can immediately calculate such a probability.

96
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:59,264
Ok, so this whole thing is the abstract definition of the product space you really should remember.

97
00:07:59,914 --> 00:08:03,190
and maybe it's easier to understand it, if we look at an example.

98
00:08:03,871 --> 00:08:07,758
So maybe we keep it simple here and stay with our ordinary die.

99
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:12,300
Now lets throw this die very often. Indeed infinitely many times. 

100
00:08:12,857 --> 00:08:18,892
Now the big advantage here you immediately see is that each of these Omegas in the cartesian product is the same.

101
00:08:19,186 --> 00:08:24,306
Of course for every throw we have the same die. Therefore we don't have to distinguish the indices here.

102
00:08:25,143 --> 00:08:29,243
Hence lets keep it simple and lets use the index 0 each time.

103
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:34,750
and of course we already know this is the probability space, where we throw the die only once.

104
00:08:35,443 --> 00:08:39,214
Accordingly we can immediately write down the corresponding product space.

105
00:08:39,757 --> 00:08:45,349
The sample space Omega is just the infinite cartesian product, where at each step we have Omega_0.

106
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:52,157
and of course the product sigma algebra "A" and the product measure "P" are immediately given by the definition above.

107
00:08:52,671 --> 00:08:57,857
Ok, now in order to make our example more concrete lets calculate the probability of a given event.

108
00:08:58,529 --> 00:09:00,256
So lets simply call the event "A".

109
00:09:00,971 --> 00:09:05,970
Here the event should be given as at the 100-th throw we get a 6 for the first time.

110
00:09:06,686 --> 00:09:09,927
Therefore the first step is always to put that into a formula.

111
00:09:10,814 --> 00:09:14,413
So what we have here is that at the first throw we don't get a 6.

112
00:09:15,071 --> 00:09:18,525
So it would be the complement of the set that only contains 6.

113
00:09:19,014 --> 00:09:22,829
The notation i use for this is simply a "c" as an upper index.

114
00:09:23,343 --> 00:09:26,714
In fact we need this set 99 times.

115
00:09:27,198 --> 00:09:32,795
After this comes the 100-th throw, which means now we have the set that only contains 6.

116
00:09:33,529 --> 00:09:37,320
Now the good thing is that we also know that afterwards it does not matter what happens.

117
00:09:38,057 --> 00:09:41,882
Therefore here only Omega_0 occurs in the cartesian product.

118
00:09:42,171 --> 00:09:47,731
Ok, now because we have the formula from above we can immediately calculate the probability of "A".

119
00:09:48,057 --> 00:09:52,434
We just have to put "P_0" in front of these sets and multiply them.

120
00:09:52,871 --> 00:09:55,389
Therefore we get this nice formula here.

121
00:09:55,843 --> 00:10:00,358
In fact it's the one probability to the power of 99 times the other one.

122
00:10:00,943 --> 00:10:07,149
Hence it's not hard to calculate we have 5 over 6 to the power 99 times 1 over 6.

123
00:10:07,771 --> 00:10:11,137
Therefore this is the probability of our event "A".

124
00:10:11,829 --> 00:10:14,978
and of course i can tell you it's very, very small.

125
00:10:15,271 --> 00:10:19,588
Ok, with this i now hope that you can work with product spaces more easily.

126
00:10:20,143 --> 00:10:23,068
and then i see you in the next video. Bye!

00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,352
Hello and welcome back to probability theory.

2
00:00:04,129 --> 00:00:09,472
and of course as always first i want to thank all the nice people that support this channel on Steady or Paypal.

3
00:00:09,957 --> 00:00:15,353
Now this is part 7 in the series and we will talk about the so called conditional Probability.

4
00:00:15,729 --> 00:00:21,472
It's a special name for a probability measure that is defined relatively to another probability measure.

5
00:00:21,957 --> 00:00:26,126
Today i will explain this definition and also show you an example.

6
00:00:26,326 --> 00:00:29,538
Now the starting point here could be any probability space.

7
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:35,325
Which means we have a sample space Omega, a sigma algebra A and probability measure P.

8
00:00:35,643 --> 00:00:39,502
Maybe here it's a good idea to visualize Omega with a rectangle.

9
00:00:40,486 --> 00:00:44,168
Hence the area should represent the probability measure P.

10
00:00:44,486 --> 00:00:47,598
Which means the whole are has the value 1.

11
00:00:47,943 --> 00:00:53,481
However if we look at a subset B in Omega. Which has probability less than 1.

12
00:00:53,681 --> 00:00:58,380
Then we can visualize that as a smaller rectangle inside Omega.

13
00:00:58,914 --> 00:01:05,157
and of course B should be an element of the sigma algebra A. Otherwise we wouldn't be able to calculate the probability.

14
00:01:05,757 --> 00:01:11,891
Now the actual restriction we have here in the following, is that the probability of B is not 0.

15
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,966
So in our picture this would mean, we have a non-vanishing rectangle.

16
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:20,848
and when we have this we get immediately a new probability measure.

17
00:01:21,048 --> 00:01:24,433
Moreover we even get the whole new probability space.

18
00:01:24,633 --> 00:01:28,581
Now instead of Omega we take B as the new sample space.

19
00:01:29,157 --> 00:01:32,171
Of course we can simply do that, but then we have the question:

20
00:01:32,243 --> 00:01:35,986
what is the new sigma algebra and what is the new probability measure?

21
00:01:36,257 --> 00:01:38,743
For the sigma algebra the answer is very straight forward.

22
00:01:38,804 --> 00:01:43,533
If you only want to work in B, we can only consider subsets of B.

23
00:01:43,733 --> 00:01:50,498
So we can take any element A from the original sigma algebra, if it fulfills that A is a subset of B.

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,894
and then of course we could measure the probability of A as before.

25
00:01:55,094 --> 00:01:59,255
Therefore P tilde could simply be the same probability measure as before.

26
00:01:59,714 --> 00:02:03,826
So in our picture it would just give us the area of the set A.

27
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:10,774
However there we see a problem, because the maximal area we would get out, would be the area of B.

28
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,791
Which is in general not 1.

29
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,502
Indeed what we rather want would be a ratio.

30
00:02:16,702 --> 00:02:20,693
So the ratio of the area of A to the area of B.

31
00:02:21,071 --> 00:02:25,630
Hence in our formula we have that P(A) gets divided by P(B).

32
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:28,843
Only now we have a well defined probability measure.

33
00:02:29,043 --> 00:02:33,473
Because now when we put in the sample space B, we get out 1.

34
00:02:34,086 --> 00:02:39,205
Ok, now i can tell you this is almost a full idea of a conditional probability.

35
00:02:39,405 --> 00:02:44,916
I say almost, because actually we don't want to change the sample space and the sigma algebra.

36
00:02:45,371 --> 00:02:51,223
In other words this means that we also have to consider sets A that are not subsets of B.

37
00:02:51,957 --> 00:02:54,305
For example they could look like this.

38
00:02:54,700 --> 00:03:00,400
So as you can see, it could have a very large area, but the intersection with the set B could be small.

39
00:03:00,923 --> 00:03:06,618
Therefore you might already know how we can transform this definition here to the whole space Omega.

40
00:03:06,914 --> 00:03:11,745
So our new probability space only gets a new probability measure.

41
00:03:11,945 --> 00:03:14,573
and for the moment lets put an index B to it.

42
00:03:15,157 --> 00:03:20,921
Now for the definition please remind yourself that we still want to measure the ratio of 2 areas.

43
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:26,257
Which means the denominator is the same as before. Which means the whole area of B,

44
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,351
but the numerator should now be this area.

45
00:03:29,551 --> 00:03:33,778
Speaking of probabilities this would be the probability of the intersection.

46
00:03:34,343 --> 00:03:40,414
and now this is the definition of the conditional probability of an event A under the event B.

47
00:03:40,457 --> 00:03:44,334
Therefore i would suggest putting this into formal definition.

48
00:03:44,914 --> 00:03:52,221
Of course the assumptions are the same as before. We have a probability space and also a set B, with a nonzero probability.

49
00:03:52,457 --> 00:03:56,843
and then we can define the conditional probability as a new probability measure.

50
00:03:57,457 --> 00:04:04,110
In fact sometimes this index notation is used for this probability measure, but often we have another notation.

51
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:10,819
Namely one uses the bar inside the parentheses and puts the condition, the set B, to the right hand side.

52
00:04:11,371 --> 00:04:16,500
and then we call this number the conditional probability of the event A under the condition B.

53
00:04:17,186 --> 00:04:23,098
Moreover if one wants to talk about the abstract probability measure, one uses the following notation.

54
00:04:23,614 --> 00:04:26,742
We simply put a dot, where the set should go in.

55
00:04:26,942 --> 00:04:31,845
and then we call this well defined measure the conditional probability measure given B.

56
00:04:32,045 --> 00:04:39,442
Ok, then please never forget this measure has an important property. Namely when we put in B, we get out 1.

57
00:04:39,871 --> 00:04:42,151
Of course this something we get immediately out.

58
00:04:42,614 --> 00:04:47,723
Speaking of this definition here, you see it won't work if P(B) would be 0.

59
00:04:47,923 --> 00:04:52,081
However now sometimes it happens that we simply don't want to check that.

60
00:04:52,429 --> 00:04:57,471
Maybe we don't have enough information, but we still want to calculate with the conditional probabilities.

61
00:04:58,143 --> 00:05:04,081
Therefore in this case we will use the following definition. This symbol just represents the number 0 then.

62
00:05:04,629 --> 00:05:07,683
This will be useful for a lot formulas later.

63
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:12,444
However please not here in this case, we don't have such a probability measure.

64
00:05:12,829 --> 00:05:16,915
Ok, so i think that's enough for the definition. Lets look at an example.

65
00:05:17,671 --> 00:05:21,491
and as often it's helpful to talk about the general urn model.

66
00:05:21,691 --> 00:05:25,558
So i would say lets do something new and look at an ordered one.

67
00:05:25,971 --> 00:05:30,311
and to keep it simple, lets consider only 4 balls with 2 different colours.

68
00:05:30,686 --> 00:05:36,841
Then lets do 2 steps. First we take out one ball. We don't replace it and then we take out the second one.

69
00:05:37,743 --> 00:05:40,982
Hence a sample we get is always an ordered pair.

70
00:05:41,182 --> 00:05:44,458
It has a first position and also a second position.

71
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:51,897
This means when we introduce a coloured set C with 2 colours, which is in our case green and red.

72
00:05:52,097 --> 00:05:57,281
Then the sample space Omega is given by the cartesian product of C with itself.

73
00:05:57,481 --> 00:06:02,378
Ok and the sigma algebra as for all discrete models, is given by the power set.

74
00:06:02,757 --> 00:06:06,782
So the only thing missing here would be the probability measure itself.

75
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:13,115
Also here since we have a discrete model, the probability measure is given by a probability mass function.

76
00:06:13,729 --> 00:06:19,990
and the best way to calculate this, is to look here at the different stages we have in our random experiment.

77
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:24,343
Therefore i would say a visualisation with a tree can really help.

78
00:06:24,725 --> 00:06:30,680
So the first stage is very simple. We just take out one ball and the probabilities should be very clear.

79
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,237
3/4 in the favour of green and 1/4 in the favour of red.

80
00:06:35,771 --> 00:06:41,232
Ok, then in the second stage we take out a second ball. Which also can be either green or red.

81
00:06:41,686 --> 00:06:46,985
However now we have different probabilities, because we have fewer balls left in the urn.

82
00:06:47,186 --> 00:06:51,742
So for the left hand side we have 2/3 for green and 1/3 for red.

83
00:06:52,171 --> 00:06:58,046
Yet on the right hand side there are no red balls left. Therefore we have 1 for green and 0 for red.

84
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:05,075
Ok, then in summary with each path in the tree, we have exactly one value for the probability mass function.

85
00:07:05,757 --> 00:07:12,647
For example for this part we first have green then red. So we have 3/4 times 1/3.

86
00:07:12,847 --> 00:07:15,482
Which is simply 1/4.

87
00:07:16,314 --> 00:07:20,398
On the other hand, first green, then green again gives us 1/2.

88
00:07:20,786 --> 00:07:23,443
Then red, green is also 1/4.

89
00:07:23,486 --> 00:07:25,629
and the other one is 0.

90
00:07:26,414 --> 00:07:32,584
Ok there we have the whole probability measure and now we can finally talk about the conditional probability.

91
00:07:32,957 --> 00:07:37,860
Therefore lets fix a condition B. So an event from the sigma algebra A.

92
00:07:38,014 --> 00:07:41,711
In words, for example this could be: the first ball is green.

93
00:07:42,071 --> 00:07:47,044
and in the formula this would just mean we take the 2 events that have green at the beginning.

94
00:07:47,244 --> 00:07:50,876
So this is our subset of Omega, we want as a condition.

95
00:07:51,357 --> 00:07:56,457
and then lets calculate the probability of (g, r) under the condition B.

96
00:07:56,946 --> 00:08:01,243
So this is a nice conditional probability which shouldn't be so hard to calculate.

97
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:05,116
Indeed we can immediately use the definition and write it down.

98
00:08:05,316 --> 00:08:10,943
So in the numerator we have the intersection and in the denominator we have the probability of B.

99
00:08:11,447 --> 00:08:14,600
Of course this intersection here we can immediately simplify.

100
00:08:15,343 --> 00:08:19,011
and now this probability of (g, r) we already know.

101
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:24,144
and in addition we also know the probability of B is given by 3/4.

102
00:08:24,843 --> 00:08:28,369
Hence the overall result here is 1/3.

103
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:31,827
So this is our conditional probability here.

104
00:08:32,027 --> 00:08:37,999
and maybe it's not so surprising, but still interesting, we find the number also here in the tree.

105
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:43,240
This is the case, because this first step here was exactly our condition B.

106
00:08:43,686 --> 00:08:49,493
However it's important to know that the notion conditional probability is not restricted to such cases.

107
00:08:49,943 --> 00:08:53,096
In fact any event could work as an condition.

108
00:08:53,296 --> 00:08:58,214
Later we will see more examples and then we will also talk about independence.

109
00:08:58,528 --> 00:09:01,253
Which is indeed related to the conditional probability.

110
00:09:01,714 --> 00:09:06,488
and with this i hope i see you in the next videos about probability theory.

111
00:09:06,857 --> 00:09:09,000
Have a nice day and bye!

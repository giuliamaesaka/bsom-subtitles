Hello and welcome back to the video series about ODEs.

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:10,882
It's a long name and therefore often we just say ODE

3
00:00:11,343 --> 00:00:19,114
and in today's part 4 we will show that any system of ODEs can be reduced to a first order system.

4
00:00:19,571 --> 00:00:27,369
This is very helpful, because it means that we can describe the theory just with first order ODEs.

5
00:00:27,757 --> 00:00:34,418
It also means that we can always use this nice directional field we have introduced in the last video.

6
00:00:34,871 --> 00:00:38,200
Ok, but before we start with the formulas, you already know,

7
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:43,707
first I want to thank all the nice people, who support this channel on Steady, via Paypal or by other means.

8
00:00:44,243 --> 00:00:49,010
Only because of your support I'm able to create such video courses here

9
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:55,886
and please don't forget you can download the PDF version and the quiz for this video, with the link in the description.

10
00:00:56,229 --> 00:01:00,386
Ok, then let's start with the topic of today by looking at an example.

11
00:01:00,914 --> 00:01:05,216
We choose that the highest derivative we have is the third derivative

12
00:01:05,943 --> 00:01:10,366
and then this should be equal to the cosine of the second derivative.

13
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,879
Plus first derivative squared + x.

14
00:01:15,271 --> 00:01:20,249
So this is what we would call an explicit ODE of third order.

15
00:01:20,686 --> 00:01:27,890
Moreover the time variable t is not involved on the right-hand side here. So it's a so called autonomous ODE.

16
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:34,643
and now I will show that we can reduce this ODE to a system of ODEs of first order

17
00:01:34,843 --> 00:01:42,090
and this simply works by defining a vector variable y that has the derivatives of x as components.

18
00:01:42,843 --> 00:01:51,743
More precisely the first component should be x, then comes x dot and the last component, the third component is x dot dot.

19
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:59,320
So you see, all the functions x here on the right-hand side are now written as components of a vector.

20
00:01:59,743 --> 00:02:04,421
So instead of 3 functions, we now have 1 vector with 3 components

21
00:02:04,621 --> 00:02:12,658
and now the idea is that we can rewrite the original ODE, the equation from above, with the help of the components of y.

22
00:02:12,858 --> 00:02:19,630
So this means that the third derivative of x is now the first derivative of the third component of y

23
00:02:20,071 --> 00:02:25,301
and then on the right-hand side we can also substitute all variables x.

24
00:02:25,501 --> 00:02:34,240
Again, the second derivative here is our y_3 and the first derivative is y_2 and x itself is y_1.

25
00:02:34,943 --> 00:02:41,145
There you see, this is the whole idea. Now the first derivative is the highest order that occurs.

26
00:02:41,714 --> 00:02:46,477
However now we also have to make the connections between the other components.

27
00:02:46,829 --> 00:02:51,122
So you see y_2 dot is equal to y_3

28
00:02:51,322 --> 00:02:55,663
and lastly we have that y_1 dot is equal to y_2.

29
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,575
Ok and there you see, this is all.

30
00:02:58,657 --> 00:03:07,417
This system of 3 equations has exactly the same information as this one ODE, where we have a third order for the derivative.

31
00:03:08,143 --> 00:03:18,131
However this was the whole idea, because now we can simply write y dot is equal to a vector function v(y).

32
00:03:18,729 --> 00:03:23,599
So know you see we have a nice system of ODEs of first order.

33
00:03:23,986 --> 00:03:33,694
So we conclude if we understand in general the system of first order ODEs, we can also understand higher order ODEs.

34
00:03:34,257 --> 00:03:42,070
However at this point you should ask: what can we do, if we have a system or an ODE which is not autonomous?

35
00:03:42,614 --> 00:03:46,255
For this let's simply look at the next example.

36
00:03:46,455 --> 00:03:52,743
So let's say we have a similar example as before, but now also t occurs on the right-hand side.

37
00:03:52,943 --> 00:03:56,064
So maybe we find -t to the power 4 here.

38
00:03:56,729 --> 00:04:01,828
Hence this is now a non-autonomous ODE, but still of third order.

39
00:04:02,314 --> 00:04:09,551
Therefore we could do the same procedure as before to get it to first order, but still it would be non-autonomous.

40
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:14,650
So we have to do one step more to get rid of this t here.

41
00:04:15,057 --> 00:04:20,408
Indeed, we could do exactly the same as before and define the vector y as above.

42
00:04:20,943 --> 00:04:25,690
However now we also have to put in the variable t in some sense

43
00:04:26,329 --> 00:04:31,942
and one thing that works very nicely is to use it as the first variable here in the vector

44
00:04:32,486 --> 00:04:37,824
and if you want to keep the Indices as before, we should call it the 0th component.

45
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:44,187
In other words our vector y has 4 components, where we start counting with 0.

46
00:04:44,614 --> 00:04:48,543
So we start with y_0, then we have y_1, y_2 and so on.

47
00:04:49,229 --> 00:04:53,087
Indeed if we do that, we can do exactly the same as above.

48
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:58,456
In other words these 3 equations from above, we can just copy here.

49
00:04:58,857 --> 00:05:03,713
The only thing to add is now, in the last equation, our 0th component.

50
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,965
So t to the power 4 is now y_0 to the power 4.

51
00:05:08,571 --> 00:05:14,167
In other words this is now autonomous, because there is no t on the right-hand side anymore.

52
00:05:14,571 --> 00:05:20,179
However this means we have to introduce a new equation to describe our t,

53
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:26,515
but of course this is very simple, because we can simply calculate the derivative of t.

54
00:05:26,715 --> 00:05:30,657
So we see y_0 dot is equal to 1.

55
00:05:30,986 --> 00:05:37,617
So in the end we see, this does not change anything. It does not make the ODEs simpler our easier to solve,

56
00:05:37,817 --> 00:05:44,951
but we see we can transform a non-autonomous ODE into a system of autonomous ODEs.

57
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:52,661
Hence in short, all explicit ODEs can be described with this formula here.

58
00:05:53,157 --> 00:05:57,677
The only thing that might change is the number of components of y.

59
00:05:57,877 --> 00:06:05,952
So this is definitely we should remember, because it explains why in our theory here we only consider this form.

60
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,940
So I would say let's write this down in general terms.

61
00:06:10,271 --> 00:06:14,257
Now assume we have an autonomous ODE of nth order.

62
00:06:14,714 --> 00:06:19,584
Then we can do the substitution as before and get a system of first order.

63
00:06:19,784 --> 00:06:23,785
However now the variable y has n components.

64
00:06:24,257 --> 00:06:30,033
So in summary we get an autonomous system of n ODEs of first order

65
00:06:30,233 --> 00:06:35,310
and now you know, we can do exactly the same, if we have a non-autonomous ODE.

66
00:06:35,986 --> 00:06:45,151
We simply do the substitution as explained here. Which means we get a system of ODEs, but y now has n+1 components.

67
00:06:45,657 --> 00:06:52,399
Ok, there we have it. The result here is again an autonomous system of ODEs of first order

68
00:06:52,971 --> 00:07:00,018
and this explains why in theorems and propositions we will always take this form for a general ODE.

69
00:07:00,218 --> 00:07:06,300
It's not a restriction at all, because we can always translate back to the original ODE.

70
00:07:06,686 --> 00:07:14,713
So for example if we have found a solution here on the right-hand side we can simply translate it to a solution for the left-hand side.

71
00:07:15,071 --> 00:07:20,014
This is no problem at all, because you see the translation here is very simple.

72
00:07:20,286 --> 00:07:29,285
Ok, I would say in order to get some practice for dealing with ODEs, we will look at some methods for solving them in the next video.

73
00:07:29,843 --> 00:07:35,453
Of course finding solutions is a very important part of this theory here.

74
00:07:35,771 --> 00:07:40,222
Therefore I hope I see you in the next video and have a nice day. Bye!

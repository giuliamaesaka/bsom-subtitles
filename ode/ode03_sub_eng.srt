00:00:00,571 --> 00:00:06,006
Hello and welcome back to the video series about ODEs

2
00:00:06,314 --> 00:00:10,578
and in today's part 3 we will talk about the directional field.

3
00:00:10,778 --> 00:00:16,886
This one will help us here at the beginning of this topic to visualize ODEs.

4
00:00:17,257 --> 00:00:23,204
Indeed it's a vector field that can be sketched such that we understand the problem.

5
00:00:23,404 --> 00:00:26,228
Ok, but before we start with that, you already know,

6
00:00:26,428 --> 00:00:31,982
first I want to thank all the nice people who support this channel on Steady via Paypal or by other means.

7
00:00:32,414 --> 00:00:39,625
In fact you should know only because of your support it's possible to create such videos about mathematics

8
00:00:39,825 --> 00:00:45,723
and as a thank you and as a bonus you can download the PDF version and the quiz for this video.

9
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:51,066
Ok, then let's start by telling again what we mean by an ODE.

10
00:00:51,266 --> 00:01:00,245
So you might remember if we write x dot (the first derivative of x) is equal to a function w, then we have an ODE.

11
00:01:00,614 --> 00:01:06,888
Moreover this function w has the independent variable t as an input and x itself.

12
00:01:07,357 --> 00:01:15,265
In addition you should know that x can be a vector. So we can have a whole system of ODEs.

13
00:01:15,465 --> 00:01:24,051
However to be more precise you have already learned that an ODE of this form is called explicit and of first order.

14
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:32,428
This means that we only have the first derivative in the whole equation and the first derivative is also alone on the left-hand side.

15
00:01:32,743 --> 00:01:39,747
However, I can already tell you that in the next video we will show that this is not really a restriction.

16
00:01:40,243 --> 00:01:45,924
Indeed, we will see that we can simplify that even more without losing generality

17
00:01:46,124 --> 00:01:50,268
and in order to see that let's first look at some examples here

18
00:01:50,829 --> 00:01:56,437
and the first one here should be the ODE x dot is equal to lambda times x.

19
00:01:56,743 --> 00:02:03,945
So a very common example, but what we should see here is that the function w doesn't depend on t.

20
00:02:04,145 --> 00:02:09,769
Hence the independent variable, the time variable, does not occur in the equation.

21
00:02:09,969 --> 00:02:15,787
Therefore we introduce a new name for such ODEs. They are called autonomous.

22
00:02:16,286 --> 00:02:21,619
On the contrary we can immediately think of an example which is not autonomous.

23
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:25,415
Namely x dot is equal to t.

24
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:30,561
There the first variable t will change the value of the function w.

25
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,983
Hence this one is an ODE, but not an autonomous ODE

26
00:02:36,329 --> 00:02:40,871
and of course this notion can also be used for a system of ODEs.

27
00:02:40,986 --> 00:02:43,525
For example in 2-dimensions.

28
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:48,708
So here x dot is equal to (x_2, -x_1).

29
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:56,415
So you see, there is no t on the right-hand side here. Hence the whole system is also called autonomous.

30
00:02:56,971 --> 00:03:03,744
Indeed, exactly these systems will be the interesting ones so let's consider them for the rest of the video

31
00:03:04,214 --> 00:03:08,005
and of course we have to put this into a new definition.

32
00:03:08,386 --> 00:03:12,942
In fact we want to keep it short and just call it an autonomous system.

33
00:03:13,614 --> 00:03:20,457
So it means we have a system of ODEs and the function w on the right-hand side does not depend on t.

34
00:03:20,786 --> 00:03:25,644
Therefore we can just write it as a function w only depending on x.

35
00:03:26,129 --> 00:03:34,945
Moreover you know we have a whole system, so this can be a vector equation. Which means the function v maps R^n to R^n.

36
00:03:35,471 --> 00:03:41,024
However in general you know v can have a domain so it maps U into R^n,

37
00:03:41,486 --> 00:03:45,864
but of course U should then be a subset of R^n as well

38
00:03:46,357 --> 00:03:50,556
and indeed often we will choose U as an open set.

39
00:03:50,756 --> 00:03:58,716
Moreover I would also say that all the times you see that v is at least a continuous function defined on U.

40
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:04,640
Ok, but now the point is, such an autonomous system can be nicely visualized

41
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,629
and this is done by the so called directional field.

42
00:04:09,086 --> 00:04:15,331
I would say this is easy to understand, because it's simply a plot of our function v.

43
00:04:15,614 --> 00:04:20,870
So you could say this is a vector field which visualizes the function v.

44
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:26,232
Therefore you would start with the domain U. Which is a subset of R^n.

45
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:30,333
So for example it could be the whole R^2.

46
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:36,267
Hence here let's visualize an example where v maps R^2 into R^2.

47
00:04:36,886 --> 00:04:44,937
So if you choose any point p in this coordinate system, the resulting value of v will also be a vector

48
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:50,911
and this vector we can simply visualize as an arrow starting at p.

49
00:04:51,111 --> 00:04:55,552
Now, this is a common way to explain a vector function like v

50
00:04:55,752 --> 00:05:02,331
and now of course the important fact here is that you could do it at any other point in this coordinate system

51
00:05:03,114 --> 00:05:07,052
and then you simply have a picture with a lot of arrows.

52
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:14,761
However we now call it the directional field of the ODE, because it explains what solutions have to do.

53
00:05:14,961 --> 00:05:24,790
Namely the ODE, the whole system of ODEs says that at a given point this vector is exactly the derivative of the solution.

54
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:31,179
Indeed this fits nicely in with the pictures of the orbits we had in the last video.

55
00:05:31,379 --> 00:05:36,961
Please note, an orbit would be the image of a solution here in our domain.

56
00:05:37,557 --> 00:05:47,257
However, now we know this can only be a solution of our system if at each point the vector we see is a tangent for this curve.

57
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:54,849
Simply because at each point the vectors here tell us in which direction the solution should flow.

58
00:05:55,049 --> 00:05:59,671
In other words if we plot the directional field of this vector function v,

59
00:05:59,757 --> 00:06:04,171
we can already see what the solutions can do and what they can't do.

60
00:06:04,714 --> 00:06:12,508
Therefore this whole thing here is already very helpful to see the behaviour of possible solutions of the ODE,

61
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:17,075
but of course this whole procedure here, we should explain with examples

62
00:06:17,657 --> 00:06:21,354
and first let's start with a 1-dimensional example.

63
00:06:21,554 --> 00:06:25,163
So x dot should be equal to the sine of x.

64
00:06:25,457 --> 00:06:31,305
So not too complicated, but we also realize that we don't see all the solutions immediately.

65
00:06:31,714 --> 00:06:37,521
However we can recognize that v is defined on the whole real number line

66
00:06:37,721 --> 00:06:42,904
and this means that our directional field is now just a 1-dimensional picture.

67
00:06:43,471 --> 00:06:48,944
Hence for the arrows we want to draw in there are only 2 possible directions.

68
00:06:49,614 --> 00:06:56,343
To see what happens here let's look at some important points like 0, pi/2, pi and so on.

69
00:06:56,543 --> 00:07:01,709
Of course we choose exactly these numbers, because of the sine function.

70
00:07:01,909 --> 00:07:08,542
So for example if we put pi/2 into our function v, we get out 1.

71
00:07:08,742 --> 00:07:13,757
In other words we have an arrow of length 1 that points to the right.

72
00:07:14,329 --> 00:07:24,341
On the other hand if we choose 3/2 times pi and put that into our function v, we get out -1. So an arrow that points to the left.

73
00:07:24,929 --> 00:07:31,508
So you see this is what we could do for all points on the real number line and then we get the whole directional field.

74
00:07:32,171 --> 00:07:40,891
So as another example if you choose a small, positive number here on the right of 0, we also get an arrow that points to the right.

75
00:07:41,543 --> 00:07:48,081
However please note at the point 0 and the point pi, we simply get out 0.

76
00:07:48,281 --> 00:07:53,046
This means at these points, there is no arrow pointing anywhere,

77
00:07:53,486 --> 00:07:59,029
but exactly that is immediately an important information for the solutions.

78
00:07:59,586 --> 00:08:05,100
So for example you could take a solution alpha(t) that is always 0.

79
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:09,996
So it means alpha(t) vanishes no matter which t you put in

80
00:08:10,196 --> 00:08:14,151
and now we can simply check that this is indeed a solution.

81
00:08:14,351 --> 00:08:19,228
This is not hard to do. You simply put alpha into the ODE.

82
00:08:19,428 --> 00:08:24,718
So we want that alpha-dot(t) is equal to sin(alpha(t)).

83
00:08:25,857 --> 00:08:35,824
So this is what a solution has to fulfill for all t and here we don't have a problem, because the derivative is 0 and sin(0) is also 0.

84
00:08:36,571 --> 00:08:40,596
So here we simply have 0 = 0.

85
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:48,927
Now, this is important to remember. This always works if you find a point in the directional field that has no arrow at all

86
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:54,006
and therefore we can immediately give a second solution alpha(t).

87
00:08:54,486 --> 00:08:58,651
We simply choose it as the constant function will value pi.

88
00:08:58,851 --> 00:09:06,799
Indeed, with the same reasoning this is also a solution, because the derivative is 0 and sin(pi) is 0

89
00:09:07,314 --> 00:09:11,591
and the important fact is that this claim holds for all t in R.

90
00:09:12,429 --> 00:09:19,130
In other words you see here that we have solutions that stay with their orbit just on one point

91
00:09:19,657 --> 00:09:24,467
and for this reason these points in the picture are called stationary points.

92
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:30,406
However the directional field does not only tell us about the constant solutions here.

93
00:09:31,214 --> 00:09:37,499
Moreover you should see that we also get information about the solution that lies in here.

94
00:09:37,699 --> 00:09:42,717
In particular we can look at a solution that hits the value pi/2.

95
00:09:42,917 --> 00:09:51,686
There we know if we now increase t, we have to go to the right with the solution, because this is the direction of the arrow.

96
00:09:52,057 --> 00:09:57,362
Indeed, this is the direction of all the arrows in the interval 0 to pi.

97
00:09:58,057 --> 00:10:05,816
Therefore we can directly conclude that a solution inside this interval has to be monotonically increasing.

98
00:10:06,186 --> 00:10:14,054
Moreover we also see that we can't exceed the value pi in the end, because pi is a stationary point.

99
00:10:14,829 --> 00:10:20,244
This means if we go with t to infinity, we will approach this value pi.

100
00:10:20,514 --> 00:10:27,326
So this is very nice. Without knowing the explicit solution, we can already say something about its behaviour.

101
00:10:28,043 --> 00:10:30,920
So this is the big advantage of the directional field.

102
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,483
It helps you immediately with understanding solutions.

103
00:10:34,683 --> 00:10:40,736
However maybe the whole thing is more interesting if we look at a higher dimensional example.

104
00:10:41,586 --> 00:10:46,883
So I would say let's take a 2-dimensional one and a similar one to the last video.

105
00:10:47,486 --> 00:10:53,306
So x_1 dot should be -x_2 and x_2 dot should be x_1.

106
00:10:53,829 --> 00:10:58,395
So here our function v goes from R^2 into R^2.

107
00:10:58,929 --> 00:11:04,103
Hence there the directional field can be visualized in a 2-dimensional plane.

108
00:11:04,757 --> 00:11:10,634
Each point in the plane get's mapped to a vector which is given by (-x_2, x_1).

109
00:11:11,186 --> 00:11:16,247
Therefore let's draw the plane and let's visualize this directional field.

110
00:11:16,814 --> 00:11:24,203
Indeed, we see that this whole picture is not so complicated, because essentially it's just flipping the arrows.

111
00:11:24,957 --> 00:11:30,686
Therefore the arrows also get longer if we get further away from the origin.

112
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:37,478
Of course now we could fill in the whole picture and what you should see is such a rotational field.

113
00:11:38,014 --> 00:11:42,129
Now, if you don't want to draw it by hand, you can also use a computer.

114
00:11:42,178 --> 00:11:45,753
For example Python will make this nice picture.

115
00:11:46,529 --> 00:11:52,354
There please note, I have shortened the arrows such that you can see this nice flow here.

116
00:11:52,886 --> 00:12:00,121
In other words, if we have a solution, it will go around the origin. Namely in the positive direction.

117
00:12:00,643 --> 00:12:05,641
That simply because we now know, a solution has to follow the arrows.

118
00:12:06,243 --> 00:12:11,285
Hence in our example here, the orbits will look like circles.

119
00:12:12,029 --> 00:12:18,899
So the result is the same as before. We can already sketch solutions with the help of the directional fields.

120
00:12:19,357 --> 00:12:25,665
Moreover we also see that we have a stationary solution, a stationary point in the picture.

121
00:12:26,286 --> 00:12:29,902
Indeed, there is only one and it is the origin.

122
00:12:30,729 --> 00:12:36,967
Ok, so in summary you see, the directional field helps us a lot to visualize solutions.

123
00:12:37,486 --> 00:12:44,320
However some questions remain. What does it tell us about the existence and uniqueness of solutions?

124
00:12:45,071 --> 00:12:49,447
And I tell you, these questions we will answer with the next videos.

125
00:12:49,971 --> 00:12:54,200
So I really hope we meet again and have a nice day. Bye!

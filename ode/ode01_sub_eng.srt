00:00:00,457 --> 00:00:06,276
Hello and welcome to the new video series about ordinary differential equations.

2
00:00:07,114 --> 00:00:14,859
This will be a video series for everyone who is interested in the theory of differential equations and how to solve them.

3
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:17,729
So essentially it's a mathematics course,

4
00:00:17,757 --> 00:00:23,161
but it's also important for a lot of other science subjects, where differential equations occur.

5
00:00:23,657 --> 00:00:31,101
Therefore you might have already seen a differential equation. For example f'=f is a common one. 

6
00:00:31,301 --> 00:00:38,697
Roughly speaking this equation means that we search for a function f, that is differentiable and fulfills this equation.

7
00:00:38,897 --> 00:00:45,098
More precisely here it means that the derivative of the function f is equal to the function itself

8
00:00:45,298 --> 00:00:50,414
and then you might already find, that the exponential function does the job.

9
00:00:50,671 --> 00:00:55,386
So f(x) = e^x solves this differential equation.

10
00:00:55,929 --> 00:01:00,733
Ok, at this point I would say a lot of questions immediately occur.

11
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:06,651
First, how can we solve such an equation if we don't have any idea, what the solution could be?

12
00:01:06,971 --> 00:01:12,707
Second, in the case that find a solution, what can we say about the uniqueness of this solution?

13
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:19,571
Moreover, besides the existence and uniqueness of solutions, you could also ask smart questions, like

14
00:01:19,586 --> 00:01:22,220
what is the domain of definition for a solution here

15
00:01:22,257 --> 00:01:24,597
and can it be different for different solutions?

16
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:30,385
Indeed all these questions and many more, we will answer in this video course here

17
00:01:30,743 --> 00:01:37,975
and a good starting point would be to talk about the prerequisite you need to understand all the videos here.

18
00:01:38,175 --> 00:01:45,010
However before we do that, I really want to thank all the nice people who support me on Steady, via Paypal or by other means.

19
00:01:45,514 --> 00:01:51,976
This freely available video course only exists, because nice people support the production of it

20
00:01:52,176 --> 00:01:58,323
and indeed as a supporter you get rewards like quizzes and PDF versions for all the videos.

21
00:01:58,857 --> 00:02:01,963
To find them, just click the link in the description.

22
00:02:02,514 --> 00:02:09,138
Ok, now let's talk about the requirements. The knowledge you need to understand ordinary differential equations.

23
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:15,086
In fact there are 2 main ingredients here. On the one side you need to know what derivatives are.

24
00:02:15,214 --> 00:02:17,087
So you need the real analysis part

25
00:02:17,287 --> 00:02:21,549
and then you need to calculate with vectors. So you need the linear algebra part.

26
00:02:22,143 --> 00:02:26,942
For both topics I have video courses, where you can watch the relevant parts.

27
00:02:27,471 --> 00:02:35,090
However, if you are very new to mathematics, I would like to suggest that you first watch my "start learning mathematics" course.

28
00:02:35,686 --> 00:02:43,769
There I tell you about typical notations, what numbers are, what sets are. So all the foundations you need to understand the rest here.

29
00:02:44,371 --> 00:02:49,748
Ok, so now you know what we need and you see, we don't need a lot of multivariable calculus.

30
00:02:49,948 --> 00:02:53,384
Simply because we will not talk about partial differential equations.

31
00:02:53,886 --> 00:02:59,559
So we will not consider partial derivatives in the equations just ordinary derivatives.

32
00:03:00,271 --> 00:03:04,594
Indeed this makes the whole topic much easier to deal with.

33
00:03:05,043 --> 00:03:12,029
However in order to motivate you why ordinary differential equations are still interesting and very important

34
00:03:12,114 --> 00:03:14,457
let's look at some other examples.

35
00:03:15,057 --> 00:03:21,886
So for example you might know that in physics one uses dots for denoting the time derivative.

36
00:03:22,571 --> 00:03:27,071
Hence this here is the second derivative of the function x(t)

37
00:03:27,314 --> 00:03:30,928
and now this should be equal to omega squared x.

38
00:03:31,714 --> 00:03:37,529
Indeed, in physics this equation here describes a so called harmonic oscillator

39
00:03:37,829 --> 00:03:43,343
and depending on how much you want to calculate with complex numbers, we have a minus sign here or not

40
00:03:43,543 --> 00:03:49,972
and there I should tell you, if you don't know complex numbers, you should check out my "start learning mathematics" series.

41
00:03:50,671 --> 00:03:55,693
However in the end here complex numbers will only be important for some calculations.

42
00:03:56,157 --> 00:04:01,036
Ok, so now we can consider another example, also given by physics.

43
00:04:01,643 --> 00:04:07,881
Indeed, this one is easy to explain. You just have 3 planets here and they will gravity.

44
00:04:08,357 --> 00:04:11,412
So simply said they will attract each other

45
00:04:11,843 --> 00:04:20,600
and now if you describe the one planet in the 3 dimensions with a vector x and the one with a vector y and the 3rd one with a vector z,

46
00:04:20,671 --> 00:04:23,682
then we can use newton's gravity.

47
00:04:24,057 --> 00:04:30,191
So the mass m times x, second derivative is equal to the gravity force.

48
00:04:30,757 --> 00:04:36,393
However, this force F now is a function that depends on all the positions here.

49
00:04:36,657 --> 00:04:42,086
Hence the equations for the different planets here are connected by this force.

50
00:04:42,571 --> 00:04:48,381
So you see, we have 9 differential equations that are completely cross linked here.

51
00:04:49,086 --> 00:04:53,168
Hence we would say, we have a whole system of differential equations

52
00:04:53,368 --> 00:04:55,571
and we want to solve the whole system.

53
00:04:55,971 --> 00:05:01,919
Moreover, you see here in contrast to the first example, we have second order derivatives here.

54
00:05:02,543 --> 00:05:10,266
However, we will see that for the theory of ordinary differential equations the order of the derivatives is not so important.

55
00:05:10,914 --> 00:05:16,033
Ok and this brings me to a short overview what we will do in this course.

56
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:21,821
So the first I already told you. We will talk about systems of differential equations.

57
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:29,189
Moreover in the future we will abbreviate ordinary differential equations by ODE.

58
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:35,514
Ok, then after this abstract theory we will talk about some practical solution methods.

59
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:41,542
So we will look at the procedure, how to solve such a system of ODE

60
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,784
and then we will go back to the theory again and prove the existence and uniqueness of solutions.

61
00:05:48,984 --> 00:05:54,631
In particular we will see, what are the correct assumptions we need to have uniqueness

62
00:05:54,831 --> 00:06:00,076
and then in the end we will also talk about linear ODE.

63
00:06:00,529 --> 00:06:05,312
There the so called matrix exponential function will play a crucial role.

64
00:06:05,971 --> 00:06:12,342
So this is the plan for this course and I would say, let's start with the important definitions in the next video.

65
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,236
Therefore let's meet there and have a nice day. Bye!

Hello and welcome to linear algebra
A whole video course I designed for everyone 

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:12,160
who wants to start with the basics in mathematics
and in the end wants to master vectors,  

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,760
vector spaces, matrices and so on.
However, before we start I really  

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,280
want to thank the nice supporters
that make this course possible. 

5
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,480
Each small contribution on Steady or 
PayPal makes it easier for me to spend 

6
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,400
to create these videos here. 

7
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:34,480
Therefore, on Steady you find quizzes and 
the pdf versions for all the videos here. 

8
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:41,840
Okay, now you might know I already have 
some calculation videos in linear algebra. 

9
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,680
But with this course here, you 
finally get the whole structure  

10
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,480
and should be able to learn linear algebra,
by watching the videos in the right order. 

11
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:56,640
Indeed, linear algebra as a whole is 
a very important topic in mathematics, 

12
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,880
and it has a lot of different applications. 

13
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:04,400
One application, I can visualise 
immediately with a short drawing here. 

14
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:10,000
Just imagine in the problem you want to 
solve, a lot of variables are involved. 

15
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,720
For example, we could have some 
fixed quantities, we just call  

16
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,160
a, b, c, d and so on.
And on the other hand,  

17
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:21,920
we also could have some variables
where we don't know the value yet. 

18
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,720
Therefore, we call them unknowns,
and here we denote them by x,y,z. 

19
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,440
Hence, in order to solve your problem.
You want to find possible values for x,y,z. 

20
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,880
And exactly there, linear algebra can help
when we know the relations between the quantities. 

21
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:47,440
However, it turns out, we need simply 
relations between our variables. 

22
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:55,360
Then, when we have this, we can use linear algebra
to find all possible solutions for the unknowns 

23
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:02,240
Therefore, linear algebra is the important 
tool which helps us solving our problem. 

24
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,320
So, you could say: 

25
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,040
Giving calculation rules for solutions 
is one part of linear algebra. 

26
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:16,000
Indeed, this is important.
But in order to understand the topic in a whole, 

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,120
we need to go abstract.
Therefore, this abstract level is something, 

28
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,560
we also will discuss in this course.
For example, on this abstract level, 

29
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,160
we will find a fundamental concept
we call a vector space. 

30
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,840
Then, in this space, we will 
find objects, we call vectors. 

31
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,480
And we will find out, we can 
do a lot with these vectors, 

32
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,160
which leads us to a new concept, we call
a linear map. 

33
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,840
Hence, there we have now something 
that can transform vectors. 

34
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:55,520
Now, please don't be deterred here because
we don't start at the abstract level. 

35
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,120
First, we will consider we will 
consider a very concrete level. 

36
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:06,000
This means, instead of an abstract vector space,
we start with something, we can call Rn. 

37
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,720
Then, on this level, a linear 
map just corresponds to 

38
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:16,320
something we can put into a table.
And such a table, we just call a matrix. 

39
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,440
Okay, now we now:
In this course,  

40
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,640
we first discuss the concrete level here
and then we go to the abstract level afterwards. 

41
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,640
Of course, there are some 
prerequisites for this course 

42
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,280
you should know. 

43
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:33,520
However, the good thing is, 
I have a whole series about 

44
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,480
start learning mathematics 
that should help you there. 

45
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:42,400
Now, you don't have know all the topics there
but it would be helpful if you  

46
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,960
gather a basic knowledge about
logical symbols, set operations and maps. 

47
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,760
In particular, working with maps, 
will be important immediately. 

48
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,680
Then, with this knowledge, 
I would say, you are ready 

49
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,400
to start with linear algebra here.
Therefore, in the next video,  

50
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,240
we can immediately talk about
vectors and how to calculate with them. 

51
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:13,840
So I really hope that I see you there.
Have a nice day and bye!

Hello and welcome back to real analysis.

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:08,600
and as always i want to thank all the nice people that support this channel on Steady or Paypal.

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,560
In todays part 5 we will talk about the Sandwich theorem for limits.

4
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:19,590
In order to understand this please recall the limit theorems we have for convergent sequences.

5
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:21,380
For example they tell us

6
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,700
if we look at the sum of the sequence we get a new convergent sequence

7
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:28,250
and we also can calculate the limit in this way.

8
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:31,320
and in a similar way we get it for the product.

9
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:37,350
In particular for the product we can consider the case that "an" is a constant sequence.

10
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:41,780
This means that we can pull the constant "a" out of the limit.

11
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:45,350
Of course this property here we will use a lot.

12
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:49,210
Now i also want to show you two other properties here.

13
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:53,480
The first one we can call the monotonicity of the limit.

14
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:59,030
For this lets consider again two convergent sequences "an" and "bn".

15
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:04,099
But now at each point "n", "bn" should be greater or equal than "an".

16
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:06,490
Therefore if you draw the graph

17
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:10,200
the points for "bn" never lie below the points for "an"

18
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:14,860
Then as always the question is what happens when "n" goes to infinity.

19
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:19,810
Of course the answer is for the limit we have the same inequality.

20
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,910
However please be careful only the less or equal sign here remains.

21
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,550
So for example if you have a strict inequality here

22
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,150
you still have the less or equal sign for the limit.

23
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:33,530
Of course you can see this in the graph.

24
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,280
The points could get closer and closer to each other.

25
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:38,740
And then in the limit they would be the same.

26
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:43,550
Now the next important property i call the Sandwich theorem.

27
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,880
There we have the same inequality as before,

28
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:49,789
but now also a new sequence in the middle.

29
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,300
Lets call the sequence "cn"

30
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,310
and then in the graph we would have the points in between.

31
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:01,220
Now if you also have the information that the limit of "an" and "bn" are the same.

32
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:04,960
then we see that the point "cn" can't do so much.

33
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:10,729
If "n" goes to infinity they need to go to the same limit as "an" and "bn"

34
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:16,079
and this is the result. The sequence "cn" is also a convergent sequence,

35
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,690
where we already know the limit.

36
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:21,620
So you see this result is very helpful for calculations,

37
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,790
because you can use sequences you already know

38
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,200
to deduce that a new sequence is also convergent.

39
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:31,990
Therefore this result is one we really should prove now.

40
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:36,760
and of course there we already can use the limit theorems from the last video.

41
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:42,640
For example if you look at the new sequence given by the differerence of "bn" with "an" .

42
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:48,100
You know by limit theorems this is a convergent sequence and it has the limit 0.

43
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:55,370
Simply because of the assumption that the limit of "an" we call "a" is the same as the limit of "bn"

44
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:59,410
and the other assumption is given by the two inequalities here.

45
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:03,130
So we know all these numbers here are positive or 0.

46
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:07,680
and the same holds for the new sequence "cn - an".

47
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,570
So we know we have non-negative numbers,

48
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,480
but we don't know the limit yet.

49
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:16,640
So lets call the new sequence simply "dn" and then we know

50
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:21,720
 "dn" lies exactly between 0 and "bn - an"

51
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:26,310
Now the assumption for our sandwich theorem here looks a little bit simpler here.

52
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:31,250
and that's what we can use to prove that "dn" is indeed convergent.

53
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,329
Now using the definition of convergence for given epsilon

54
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:40,650
we find a "N" such that for all "n" greater or equal than "N"

55
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:45,950
we have that |bn - an| is less than epsilon

56
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:49,200
So this is simply the same statement we have above

57
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:54,420
saying that the sequence "bn - an" is convergent and has the limit 0.

58
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:58,100
However here we now can use this inequality

59
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:00,590
and get a statement for "dn" as well.

60
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:06,060
So "dn" is less than this absolute value and therefore also less than epsilon.

61
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:12,220
and of course the actual statement we want is to consider |dn - 0|

62
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,830
and when you read the whole sentence now

63
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:20,829
you see this is exactly the definition that "dn" is a convergent sequence with limit 0.

64
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,930
Therefore this is our conclusion now.

65
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:29,560
Ok and from this statement we have to go back to our original sequence "cn".

66
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:33,850
Which is not so hard. You see we just have to add "an" again.

67
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:41,530
and of course by the limit theorems we know that the new sequence "dn + an" is also convergent.

68
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:44,050
Namely with limit "a".

69
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:48,090
However this is now simply our sequence "cn".

70
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:51,750
and with this we have shown what we wanted to show.

71
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:54,790
So the sandwich theorem is proven.

72
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:59,290
I already told you it's very important so please remember it

73
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,900
and use it in examples where it is possible.

74
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:07,780
An important thing to note here is that you don't need the inequalites to hold for all "n"

75
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,370
It's sufficient that they hold eventually.

76
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:14,180
This means it can fail for finitely many sequence members.

77
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,860
This does not change the result.

78
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:19,710
Obviously because this is just a statement about the limit.

79
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:24,850
and the limit is just not interested in only finitely many sequence members.

80
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:28,950
Ok, knowing this lets apply the theorem for an example.

81
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:36,320
Here the sequence "cn" is given by the square root of "n^2 + 1" - "n".

82
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:40,530
and the question as always is, is this a convergent sequence?

83
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,740
and in the case it is what is the limit?

84
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,490
The Problem here is that we can't answer that immediately

85
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:50,370
simply because we have two parts here, with the subtraction 

86
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:54,270
where both parts go to infinity when "n" goes to infinity.

87
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:58,620
Therefore it's not possible to apply the limit theorems immediately.

88
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:03,960
However the trick is to get rid of the square root and the minus sign at the same time.

89
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:07,250
and it just works when we expand it to a fraction

90
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:11,260
by just multiplying with the same term, but now with a plus sign.

91
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:15,010
Of course then we have a fraction, but we can handle this,

92
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:17,440
because there is no minus sign anymore.

93
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:21,120
and in the numerator even the square root cancels out.

94
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:25,060
There you just have to do the multiplication in the correct way

95
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,960
and we get out two terms.

96
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:32,200
So we have the square root squared so it vanishes we just have "n^2 + 1"

97
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,830
and then we have minus "n^2".

98
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:39,190
The mixed terms vanish, because we have different signs here.

99
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:44,200
So you see this is very nice, because these two terms here cancel out.

100
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:48,420
So only 1 over this positive part here remains.

101
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:54,030
and now we can use that this square root here is always greater than 0.

102
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,730
No matter which natural number "n" we choose.

103
00:06:57,090 --> 00:07:01,810
and therefore this whole fraction is always less than 1 over "n"

104
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:06,790
and there you see this is exactly what we want for the sandwich theorem.

105
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,750
So that's the last part we have to write down.

106
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,670
We have the following sandwich

107
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:15,920
"cn" is always between 0 and 1 over "n".

108
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:20,630
and the left hand side and the right hand side both have the same limit.

109
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:22,930
Namely just 0.

110
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,980
Therefore also "cn" is convergent with limit 0.

111
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:29,940
and of course this is our result.

112
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,000
So that's all for our nice example here,

113
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,000
where you have seen a neat little trick

114
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:37,600
and also the application of the sandwich theorem.

115
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:41,330
Therefore please try it for yourself for other examples

116
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:44,020
and also try out the quiz i have in the description.

117
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:47,670
and with this i hope to see you in the next video. Bye!

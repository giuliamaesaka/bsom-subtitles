Hello and welcome back to real analysis

2
00:00:03,871 --> 00:00:09,415
and as always first i want to thank all the nice people that support this channel on Steady or Paypal.

3
00:00:09,786 --> 00:00:15,031
In today's part 11 we will talk about the limit superior and the limit inferior.

4
00:00:15,671 --> 00:00:20,700
Indeed both are very important concepts when you deal with sequences of real numbers.

5
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,641
Therefore let's immediately start with an example of such a sequence.

6
00:00:25,071 --> 00:00:29,046
Here each sequence member a_n is given by n.

7
00:00:29,743 --> 00:00:33,251
Now we know on the real number line this sequence looks very simple.

8
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:38,934
Obviously this sequence is not convergent, because it gets as large as you want.

9
00:00:39,134 --> 00:00:45,381
So what we could say here is that this sequence is divergent, but it's divergent to infinity.

10
00:00:46,114 --> 00:00:51,138
However please note here, we use infinity as a symbol here. Not as a number.

11
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:59,333
More concretely by definition this should mean that for any constant I give you, we find an index capital N

12
00:00:59,943 --> 00:01:04,507
such that for all indices afterwards we are greater than this constant.

13
00:01:04,707 --> 00:01:08,927
In other words the sequence exceeds any bound eventually.

14
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:17,825
In a similar way this definition works for a sequence that is not bounded from below, such that we can have the notion divergent to -infinity.

15
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,332
There our inequalities are just reversed.

16
00:01:22,014 --> 00:01:26,861
However please note, this sequence here is not divergent to -infinity.

17
00:01:27,357 --> 00:01:32,183
Of course only one of the two properties here can occur for a given sequence.

18
00:01:32,514 --> 00:01:37,126
Another thing you should remember is that we have a symbolic notation for both cases here.

19
00:01:37,586 --> 00:01:42,382
We just write that the limit of a_n is equal to the symbol infinity

20
00:01:42,443 --> 00:01:44,809
or equal to the symbol -infinity.

21
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:52,263
So you see, using the symbols here makes it easier to talk about the properties of a sequence that is not convergent.

22
00:01:52,463 --> 00:01:57,818
Another thing we introduced for such sequences is the notion of accumulation values.

23
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:06,201
For this example you might have already see, this sequence does not have any accumulation value. No cluster point at all.

24
00:02:06,743 --> 00:02:13,574
However in the same symbolic way as here, we could say this sequence here clusters at infinity.

25
00:02:14,271 --> 00:02:18,447
Therefore we define the improper accumulation value infinity.

26
00:02:18,814 --> 00:02:23,236
Namely we have that for all sequences that are not bounded from above

27
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:29,842
and of course in same way we cluster at -infinity when the sequence is not bounded from below.

28
00:02:30,557 --> 00:02:36,366
Now, this is a very nice definition, because it tells us together with the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem

29
00:02:36,566 --> 00:02:42,154
that any sequence that as no accumulation values, has at least one improper one

30
00:02:42,586 --> 00:02:48,960
and that's what we can use to be able to talk about the smallest or the largest accumulation value we can have.

31
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:54,952
For this keep in mind that a given sequence a_n could have many different accumulation values.

32
00:02:55,314 --> 00:03:02,247
Of course we can visualize that on a number line as well, but now keep in mind, we could have finitely many or infinitely many

33
00:03:02,629 --> 00:03:08,719
and maybe we also have an improper accumulation value or even two outside of the number line.

34
00:03:09,414 --> 00:03:14,666
Again, infinity and -infinity are just symbols we put next to the number line.

35
00:03:15,586 --> 00:03:19,014
There are not numbers, but they are helpful for our whole description here.

36
00:03:19,786 --> 00:03:24,037
Simply because now it makes sense to talk about the largest accumulation value.

37
00:03:24,857 --> 00:03:27,879
It could be a normal one or an improper one

38
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,775
and the same holds for the lowest one.

39
00:03:31,529 --> 00:03:33,984
Both of the now get very special names.

40
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:39,178
So here we have a definition that holds for any sequence of real numbers

41
00:03:39,971 --> 00:03:48,062
and now we consider an element "a". Either it's a real number or the symbol -infinity or +infinity

42
00:03:48,743 --> 00:03:55,306
and now this "a" is called the limit superior of the sequence a_n, if it's the largest accumulation value.

43
00:03:55,506 --> 00:03:59,755
So there is no other accumulation value, which is larger than "a".

44
00:03:59,955 --> 00:04:04,400
Additionally for this we have a common notation, you might have already seen.

45
00:04:04,706 --> 00:04:08,300
We simply write "lim sup", n to infinity of a_n.

46
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,053
Ok, with this you now know one important symbol that is very often used in analysis

47
00:04:14,386 --> 00:04:19,482
and then you might not be surprised that we can do a similar thing for the limit inferior.

48
00:04:20,157 --> 00:04:25,379
It's simply the smallest accumulation value the sequence can have or it could also be an improper one

49
00:04:26,214 --> 00:04:28,885
and then we use the notation "lim inf".

50
00:04:29,786 --> 00:04:35,702
Ok, now you might ask why exactly do we use these strange names and these notations here?

51
00:04:36,243 --> 00:04:40,397
Therefore I would say, we invest the next minutes to discuss this.

52
00:04:40,597 --> 00:04:43,370
So let's draw a graph for a given sequence.

53
00:04:43,914 --> 00:04:49,460
So we have the natural numbers on the x-axis and the real number line on the y-axis.

54
00:04:49,986 --> 00:04:55,687
In other words the y-coordinates of the points gives us the sequence members a_n.

55
00:04:55,887 --> 00:05:02,018
Therefore you should see at this value here and at this value, we have 2 accumulation values.

56
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:08,084
On the other hand here you can see this point here, gives us the largest value of the whole sequence.

57
00:05:08,414 --> 00:05:14,010
In other words this is the supremum of a_k, where k goes through all the natural numbers.

58
00:05:14,886 --> 00:05:21,641
However now you might ask: what happens with the supremum, when we ignore finitely many sequence members at the beginning?

59
00:05:21,841 --> 00:05:26,265
Therefore here i just would write k is greater or equal than 1

60
00:05:26,971 --> 00:05:31,090
and then when I look at k greater or equal than 2, nothing will change.

61
00:05:31,571 --> 00:05:34,929
We still have this point here as the largest value.

62
00:05:35,129 --> 00:05:40,045
However, if we go to 3, this value is no longer considered.

63
00:05:40,245 --> 00:05:43,472
Now we find the new largest value, which is here.

64
00:05:43,672 --> 00:05:48,271
Of course it's not possible that the supremum would be now larger than before.

65
00:05:48,471 --> 00:05:51,303
Indeed in this case it's getting smaller.

66
00:05:51,503 --> 00:05:58,228
Moreover now it stays the same at this value, until we reach the next step, which is k is greater or equal than 9.

67
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:06,363
This means that now we ignore all the points that are left on this side and then the largest value here is this one.

68
00:06:06,563 --> 00:06:12,819
Ok and now you might already see, we get even smaller when we increase the number here even more.

69
00:06:13,286 --> 00:06:17,291
For example we can choose 11 and then we find this value here

70
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:20,694
and then the supremum stays at this level.

71
00:06:20,894 --> 00:06:23,281
No matter how big this number here is

72
00:06:23,481 --> 00:06:29,337
and please recall, we already know this value here is the largest accumulation value.

73
00:06:29,537 --> 00:06:33,016
Therefore by definition, this is the limit superior

74
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:39,200
or in summary we now have learned that the limit superior describes what happens with the supremum,

75
00:06:39,257 --> 00:06:43,100
when we cut of more and more at the beginning of the sequence.

76
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,297
In this sense we have the following fact.

77
00:06:46,757 --> 00:06:54,942
The lim sup of a sequence is related to the sequence given by the supremum, where n the index is the cutoff.

78
00:06:55,142 --> 00:06:58,418
So we have k is greater or equal than n.

79
00:06:58,729 --> 00:07:02,250
So this is a well defined sequence with index n.

80
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:07,979
The only strange thing that can happen here, is that all the sequence members here are the symbol infinity.

81
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:13,052
However with the exception of this case, we get a well defined sequence of real numbers,

82
00:07:13,252 --> 00:07:17,145
where we already know, this sequence is monotonically decreasing

83
00:07:17,671 --> 00:07:22,147
and then we look at the limit of this sequence, when n goes to infinity

84
00:07:22,729 --> 00:07:29,197
and now one can show, this is exactly the largest accumulation value. Therefore our limit superior.

85
00:07:29,729 --> 00:07:36,566
Here please keep in mind, on both sides infinity and -infinity as symbols are possible.

86
00:07:36,766 --> 00:07:41,883
Also i can tell you, often this one is used for the definition of the limit superior.

87
00:07:42,514 --> 00:07:47,563
However still there it's a good exercise to show the relation between the accumulation values there.

88
00:07:48,371 --> 00:07:52,885
Ok, maybe not so surprising, we have a similar result for the limit inferior.

89
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:59,456
There we just observe what happens with the infimum, when we cut of finitely many sequence members at the beginning

90
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,854
and what we get is a sequence with index n, which is monotonically increasing.

91
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:11,629
However also here -infinity and infinity as symbols are possible on both sides.

92
00:08:11,943 --> 00:08:19,485
Ok, then I would say, examples and more properties of the limit superior and limit inferior we can discuss in the next video.

93
00:08:19,886 --> 00:08:23,314
Therefore I hope I see you there and have a nice day. Bye!

Hello and welcome back to real analysis

2
00:00:04,129 --> 00:00:09,366
and as always first I want to thank all the nice people that support this channel on Steady or Paypal.

3
00:00:09,686 --> 00:00:15,318
In today's part 19 we will talk about the so called comparison test for series.

4
00:00:15,943 --> 00:00:20,924
It's a criterion we can use to decide if a given series is convergent,

5
00:00:21,124 --> 00:00:24,592
but first we need a new definition about convergence.

6
00:00:24,792 --> 00:00:30,686
Namely we call a series given by a sequence a_k, absolutely convergent 

7
00:00:31,229 --> 00:00:36,112
if the series given by the absolute value of a_k is simply convergent.

8
00:00:36,686 --> 00:00:43,857
So what you see immediately is that for a series that has only positive a_k's, this is not a new definition at all.

9
00:00:44,386 --> 00:00:47,494
However in general it's a stronger definition.

10
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:52,645
In other words being absolutely convergent implies being convergent.

11
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:58,175
Indeed this is not hard to show, we can just use the Cauchy criterion.

12
00:00:58,375 --> 00:01:07,196
Applying this for our series here just means: For all epsilon there is an N, such that for all n, m we have

13
00:01:07,314 --> 00:01:10,740
that this finite sum here is less than epsilon.

14
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:18,961
Now, in this special case here, we know that the sum is never negative. Therefore we can omit the absolute values around it.

15
00:01:19,757 --> 00:01:26,986
Ok, but know we want to say something about the original series with a_k. So without the absolute value here inside.

16
00:01:27,643 --> 00:01:33,415
Hence what we really want is that this sum with the absolute value outside is less than epsilon.

17
00:01:33,829 --> 00:01:38,825
In order to get this we can just use the triangle inequality for the absolute value.

18
00:01:39,129 --> 00:01:45,315
It just tells us that we can push the absolute value inside the sum, but then we have an inequality.

19
00:01:45,515 --> 00:01:51,597
Now, here we already know from the line above that the right-hand side here is less than epsilon.

20
00:01:52,114 --> 00:01:58,237
So this is our implication and we just get the Cauchy criterion for our original series with a_k.

21
00:01:59,057 --> 00:02:02,185
Hence the series is convergent as well.

22
00:02:02,385 --> 00:02:06,551
Ok, now please remember that we have always this implication here.

23
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:10,101
However it does not work the other way around.

24
00:02:10,414 --> 00:02:14,172
Indeed that's what we already learned in the last video.

25
00:02:14,514 --> 00:02:19,217
Namely this series here is convergent by the Leibniz criterion.

26
00:02:19,757 --> 00:02:23,127
However it's not absolutely convergent.

27
00:02:23,327 --> 00:02:29,313
We see that immediately, because when we take the absolute value here, we get out the harmonic series.

28
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:34,696
Ok, now in summary what we have is a stronger notion of convergence

29
00:02:35,314 --> 00:02:39,127
and indeed this is exactly what we need for the comparison test.

30
00:02:39,886 --> 00:02:44,793
Now in fact, this comparison test consists of 2 separate criteria.

31
00:02:44,993 --> 00:02:48,563
The first one is the so called majorant criterion.

32
00:02:48,871 --> 00:02:54,384
If we are able to apply this, we get the absolute convergence out for a series.

33
00:02:54,584 --> 00:02:59,568
Ok, therefore let's fix a series and now I will tell you what we have to check.

34
00:02:59,768 --> 00:03:05,428
We just need another sequence b_k that is larger than the sequence a_k

35
00:03:05,986 --> 00:03:09,399
and of course we put a_k in the absolute value

36
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:14,433
and we don't need the inequality for all k, but we need it eventually.

37
00:03:14,714 --> 00:03:18,561
Hence for all k after a given index n_0.

38
00:03:18,971 --> 00:03:24,342
So the idea here is that we have another sequence b_k that is well behaved.

39
00:03:24,542 --> 00:03:28,163
In the sense that corresponding series is convergent

40
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:36,031
and then we can conclude with this inequality that the series corresponding to the absolute value a_k is also convergent.

41
00:03:36,371 --> 00:03:46,263
Therefore our premise is that we find an index n_0 and a convergent series and this series is then often called the majorant

42
00:03:46,815 --> 00:03:52,461
and of course our inequality only makes sense if the corresponding b_k's are non-negative.

43
00:03:52,661 --> 00:03:58,660
Ok and then our conclusion is that our series over a_k is absolutely convergent.

44
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:06,600
So the idea is here that we can control the whole sequence of partial sums. We simply keep the sequence members small enough.

45
00:04:07,143 --> 00:04:11,657
Now, applications for this nice theorem I show you in the next video.

46
00:04:12,071 --> 00:04:19,460
Here we first should convince ourselves that this is indeed correct and in fact this proof is very short.

47
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:25,256
We just have to apply our already known Cauchy criterion to the series over b_k.

48
00:04:25,456 --> 00:04:31,951
So this is the same as before. We find epsilon and N and get that this sum is less than epsilon.

49
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:40,144
However of course we want to say something about this sum. Now you might already know, we can just apply our inequality here.

50
00:04:40,443 --> 00:04:47,360
In other words if we substitute a_k here with b_k, we get a value that is larger or stays the same.

51
00:04:47,857 --> 00:04:54,186
The only small restriction for this calculation is that we have to choose the capital N larger than n_0

52
00:04:54,771 --> 00:04:57,585
and of course it's always possible to do that.

53
00:04:57,871 --> 00:05:02,698
Ok and then on the right-hand side these 2 things here are obviously the same.

54
00:05:03,157 --> 00:05:07,584
In summary now, this number is indeed less than epsilon.

55
00:05:07,784 --> 00:05:14,167
This simply means that the Cauchy criterion holds for the series over the absolute value of a_k.

56
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:21,890
So we have a convergent series there or to put differently the series over a_k is absolutely convergent.

57
00:05:22,243 --> 00:05:25,453
Ok and with this the whole proof is finished.

58
00:05:25,829 --> 00:05:31,433
Ok, so this was the majorant criterion, but we also have the minorant criterion.

59
00:05:31,943 --> 00:05:37,196
It works similarly, but now we don't check for convergence but for divergence.

60
00:05:37,486 --> 00:05:45,457
Therefore we almost have the same assumptions, but now we only check for series that have a sequence a_k that is non-negative.

61
00:05:45,857 --> 00:05:52,300
So now we can copy almost all things from above, but now we need a divergent series b_k

62
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:56,344
and then of course the inequality goes the other direction.

63
00:05:56,686 --> 00:06:00,955
Hence now the sequence a_k is simply too large.

64
00:06:01,155 --> 00:06:06,285
Therefore the idea here is, if this series has already the limit infinity,

65
00:06:06,485 --> 00:06:11,402
then the series over a_k, which is larger, should also have the limit infinity.

66
00:06:11,957 --> 00:06:15,125
In conclusion the series is divergent.

67
00:06:15,457 --> 00:06:21,557
Ok, the proof for this theorem is also not so hard. You can just use the majorant criterion.

68
00:06:21,757 --> 00:06:26,216
So you can do a proof by contraposition or if you want by contradiction.

69
00:06:26,614 --> 00:06:30,394
Ok, because it's a very short proof, I think it's a good exercise for you

70
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:35,701
and then we can close this video with an example for the minorant criterion.

71
00:06:35,901 --> 00:06:41,030
We will show that the series with 1 over square root of k is divergent.

72
00:06:41,486 --> 00:06:47,400
The first thing you should note here is that the square root of k is indeed less or equal than k itself.

73
00:06:48,143 --> 00:06:51,737
Hence the reciprocals fulfill the other inequality.

74
00:06:52,171 --> 00:06:56,999
So 1 over the square root of k is greater or equal than 1 over k

75
00:06:57,257 --> 00:07:01,055
and of course this holds for all natural numbers k

76
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:06,602
and at this point you see, here we have our minorant, the sequence b_k,

77
00:07:06,802 --> 00:07:14,557
because this gives us the harmonic series and we already showed that this is a divergent series.

78
00:07:15,014 --> 00:07:21,959
Hence if we are able to write down such an inequality, we immediately know that we have a divergent series as well.

79
00:07:22,343 --> 00:07:29,060
The only problem this might give you is that you don't know at the beginning, which minorant or majorant you should choose.

80
00:07:29,686 --> 00:07:34,635
Therefore in the next video I'll show you some criteria that help you exactly there,

81
00:07:34,835 --> 00:07:40,536
but still if you know what to do, the minorant and the majorant criterion can be very helpful.

82
00:07:40,857 --> 00:07:44,757
Ok, then I hope I see you in the next video. Bye!

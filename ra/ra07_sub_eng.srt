Hello and welcome back to real analysis

2
00:00:03,814 --> 00:00:08,720
and as always i want to thank all the nice people that support this channel on Steady or Paypal.

3
00:00:09,071 --> 00:00:13,526
Todays part 7 is about Cauchy sequences and completeness.

4
00:00:14,071 --> 00:00:19,972
For starting this topic lets recall what we already considered sequences with a special property.

5
00:00:20,529 --> 00:00:22,818
Namely convergent sequences.

6
00:00:23,314 --> 00:00:31,157
Which means there is a number "a" such that the sequence members here get arbitrarly close to this number "a" eventually.

7
00:00:31,671 --> 00:00:34,514
You already know the formal way to say this. Which is:

8
00:00:34,771 --> 00:00:40,538
for all epsilon there exists a capital N such that for all indices n greater than this N,

9
00:00:40,738 --> 00:00:44,911
the distance between "a" and "a_n" is less than the given epsilon.

10
00:00:45,111 --> 00:00:50,161
Now the problem with this definition is that you need to know the limit to show convergence.

11
00:00:50,543 --> 00:00:54,236
Simply because we measure the distance to this "a".

12
00:00:54,436 --> 00:01:01,547
Hence there is a different idea or a different property a sequence can have, which does not need such a number "a" in definition.

13
00:01:01,747 --> 00:01:06,185
For this lets look at a number line again and at a sequence which should converge.

14
00:01:06,957 --> 00:01:10,475
So here we have a_1, a_2, a_3 and so on

15
00:01:10,743 --> 00:01:14,678
and the sequence members accumulate here, so there should be a limit here.

16
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:19,169
However we don't want to use this limit to describe what happens here.

17
00:01:19,557 --> 00:01:24,829
Indeed what happens here is that the sequence members themselves get closer and closer to each other.

18
00:01:25,886 --> 00:01:31,488
Hence what we want is that the sequence members lie arbitraily close to each other eventually.

19
00:01:31,771 --> 00:01:36,996
So everything is about the distance you can measure between 2 sequence members here.

20
00:01:37,196 --> 00:01:40,751
Which is the absolute value of "a_n - a_m".

21
00:01:41,271 --> 00:01:44,663
and then they should be less than epsilon, we choose at the beginning.

22
00:01:45,414 --> 00:01:49,591
Therefore the formal way then reads: For all epsilon greater 0,

23
00:01:50,057 --> 00:01:56,578
we find a capital N such that for all indices called n and m afterwards,

24
00:01:57,043 --> 00:02:01,296
we have that the distance between the sequence members is less than epsilon.

25
00:02:02,143 --> 00:02:06,035
and now a sequence with this property we call a Cauchy sequence.

26
00:02:06,571 --> 00:02:09,666
Ok, so lets put that into a definition.

27
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:15,586
This is exactly the definition you might have already seen in my "start learning reals" series.

28
00:02:16,229 --> 00:02:21,250
There i also showed you the important fact that for a sequence of real numbers

29
00:02:21,786 --> 00:02:27,289
we have that being a Cauchy sequence is equivalent to being a convergent sequence.

30
00:02:28,143 --> 00:02:31,900
The prove of this direction you can see in part 2 of the course

31
00:02:32,537 --> 00:02:35,758
and the other one is exactly the completeness axiom.

32
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:41,995
So the completeness axiom tells us that there are no holes in our complete real number line.

33
00:02:42,986 --> 00:02:46,671
Now, what you really should remember is when we work in the real numbers,

34
00:02:46,743 --> 00:02:51,100
we don't have to distinguish Cauchy sequences and convergent sequences.

35
00:02:52,086 --> 00:02:56,270
They have different definitions, but for the real numbers they mean the same thing.

36
00:02:56,914 --> 00:03:02,721
Therefore we are able to use the one or the other definition, depending what is usefull in our context

37
00:03:03,343 --> 00:03:08,455
and soon we will see that the definition of the Cauchy sequences make a lot of things easier.

38
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:13,512
However before we apply this in examples lets discuss another important property.

39
00:03:14,186 --> 00:03:18,967
It's called Dedekind completeness and the property for subsets of the real numbers.

40
00:03:19,457 --> 00:03:25,600
If M is such a set and also bounded from above, then we know the supremum exists.

41
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:29,591
So there is at least upper bound as a number in R.

42
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:33,632
Please recall that we defined the supremum in the last video.

43
00:03:34,129 --> 00:03:38,413
and maybe not so surprising, we have the same thing for the infimum as well.

44
00:03:38,414 --> 00:03:43,367
So if we have a set that is bounded from below, then the infimum exists as a real number.

45
00:03:44,014 --> 00:03:46,777
Ok, let me explain how we can prove this statement.

46
00:03:47,229 --> 00:03:51,653
and i thing it's enough to give you the idea, how to do it for the supremum.

47
00:03:52,257 --> 00:03:56,218
For this lets consider the number line and the set M on it.

48
00:03:56,418 --> 00:04:02,058
Then we know we find an upper bound for the set M. So lets choose one and call it b_1.

49
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:06,439
On the other hand lets choose any element in the set M

50
00:04:06,771 --> 00:04:09,351
and this one we call just a_1.

51
00:04:09,771 --> 00:04:15,125
Now the idea is that we then go to the point that is exactly in the middle of these 2 points.

52
00:04:15,829 --> 00:04:19,130
and this one of course i now call c_1.

53
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,980
So we just calculate the sum and then we divide by 2.

54
00:04:23,343 --> 00:04:26,888
So in this case we find this mittle point somewhere here.

55
00:04:27,557 --> 00:04:34,143
Of course the idea is that by doing this calculation we get closer to this point. Which is the supremum of M in the picture.

56
00:04:34,629 --> 00:04:40,571
Therefore now i explain how we get the whole sequence. Which gives us an approximation of the supremum.

57
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:44,743
Ok, you might have already seen, we can have 2 cases for c_1.

58
00:04:44,971 --> 00:04:48,400
Either it's still an upper bound like b_1 or not.

59
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:55,071
In the first case we just have a smaller upper bound. So a better one. So we can just substitute b_1.

60
00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:00,793
Or to put it to other words, we introduce b2 to be the new upper bound given by c_1.

61
00:05:01,214 --> 00:05:05,707
On the other hand the left hand side we don't have to change. We just stay at a_1

62
00:05:06,443 --> 00:05:12,710
and then afterwards we do the same thing again now with a_2 and b_2, define the middel point as c_2.

63
00:05:13,443 --> 00:05:18,668
In this case you then would to see that the middle point lies left to some points of M.

64
00:05:18,868 --> 00:05:22,041
Therefore then we have to think what we do in the second case.

65
00:05:22,986 --> 00:05:29,100
Now, as i said here it's possible to find a point x in M, which is larger than c_1.

66
00:05:29,943 --> 00:05:33,865
Then of course this new larger point should be our new a_2.

67
00:05:34,314 --> 00:05:37,607
So with this we shifted the left point to the right

68
00:05:37,943 --> 00:05:41,386
and that we don't need to change the right hand side with b_1.

69
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:47,055
Now having this we have the whole procedure how we can form the sequences.

70
00:05:47,786 --> 00:05:55,803
So in general when we have a_n, b_n, we define cn and then as before we just define the 2 next numbers here.

71
00:05:56,386 --> 00:06:02,399
So this is a recursive definition, which gives us 2 sequences, an and bn.

72
00:06:02,671 --> 00:06:08,731
and the sequence members bn are always upper bounds, which approximate the supremum.

73
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:15,229
Therefore the only thing that remains to show is that the sequence bn is indeed a Cauchy sequence.

74
00:06:16,114 --> 00:06:20,282
However this is not hard to see, because we have the following estimate.

75
00:06:20,914 --> 00:06:25,310
Namely for 2 indices m and n, where m is greater than n

76
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:29,324
we can calculate the distance b_n to b_m.

77
00:06:29,524 --> 00:06:36,124
I used the absolute value here, but honestly we don't need it, because b_n is greater or equal than b_m

78
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:41,900
and now the distance gets larger when we substitute any "a" for this b_m

79
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,922
and the best "a" we can choose would be "a" with index n.

80
00:06:46,122 --> 00:06:51,833
Now we know by our construction with the middle point, that we always cut the distance in half.

81
00:06:52,157 --> 00:07:00,191
Therefore we know that this is 1/2 to the power "n - 1" times the starting distance |b_1 - a_1|

82
00:07:00,529 --> 00:07:04,302
and now this whole number here we can get arbitrarily small.

83
00:07:04,986 --> 00:07:11,214
This is what you can show and then you can formalize the conclusion that b_n is indeed a Cauchy sequence

84
00:07:11,578 --> 00:07:17,998
and then the last step is just using the completeness axiom to show that b_n is a convergent sequence.

85
00:07:18,814 --> 00:07:23,300
Also the only possibility for the limit then is the supremum of M.

86
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:26,545
Ok, so that's the overall idea of the whole prove.

87
00:07:26,745 --> 00:07:29,016
The missing details you can easily fit in.

88
00:07:29,216 --> 00:07:35,396
However now knowing that the supremum and infimum always exists has an important application.

89
00:07:36,114 --> 00:07:40,359
We immediately get a nice criterion to show convergence of a sequence.

90
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,208
If the sequence a_n is monotonically decreasing

91
00:07:44,671 --> 00:07:49,135
which simply means that each sequence member is less or equal than the predecessor

92
00:07:50,057 --> 00:07:53,001
and if the sequence is also bounded from below

93
00:07:53,457 --> 00:07:57,745
which simply means that the set, given by the squence member has a lower bound.

94
00:07:58,486 --> 00:08:03,088
Then we can finally conclude that the sequence is indeed a convergent sequence.

95
00:08:03,629 --> 00:08:08,946
There you see, this is a very useful criterion, because you only have to check 2 properties.

96
00:08:09,657 --> 00:08:12,914
Which could be easier to check then the definition of convergence.

97
00:08:13,614 --> 00:08:18,865
In this formulation you might already see we used the existence of the supremum of this set.

98
00:08:19,543 --> 00:08:23,883
However if we use the existence of the infimum we get another criterion.

99
00:08:24,543 --> 00:08:30,899
Of course it's very similar. There we just need a monotonically increasing sequence, which is bounded from above.

100
00:08:31,586 --> 00:08:34,386
and i then we can also conclude that we have a convergent sequence.

101
00:08:35,043 --> 00:08:39,526
Ok and then in the next video i show you some examples for this application.

102
00:08:40,386 --> 00:08:43,686
Therefore i hope i see you there and have a nice day. Bye!

Hello and welcome back to real analysis

2
00:00:04,014 --> 00:00:09,337
and as always many, many thanks to all the nice people that support this channel on Steady or Paypal.

3
00:00:09,537 --> 00:00:14,716
In today's part 10 we will talk about the so called Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem.

4
00:00:15,014 --> 00:00:19,010
It's a fundamental result you should learn in any analysis course.

5
00:00:19,614 --> 00:00:23,857
The statement itself is really short, such that i can immediately tell you it.

6
00:00:24,057 --> 00:00:27,997
For this we consider a sequence a_n, which is bounded

7
00:00:28,197 --> 00:00:33,392
and then we can conclude that this sequence has at least one accumulation value

8
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:38,734
or to put it in other words, a bounded sequence of real numbers has to cluster somewhere.

9
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:46,542
For this please recall, having an accumulation value or cluster point just means the sequence has a convergent subsequence.

10
00:00:47,043 --> 00:00:52,890
One possible visualization would be on the number line, where you have a lower bound and an upper bound.

11
00:00:53,514 --> 00:00:57,447
Therefore all the sequence member lives between does values.

12
00:00:57,647 --> 00:01:02,203
Of course they may jump around, but we still have infinitely many of them.

13
00:01:03,014 --> 00:01:07,559
Therefore you find at least 1 point, where infinitely many sequence members cluster.

14
00:01:08,471 --> 00:01:12,100
Indeed that's the whole statement of the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem.

15
00:01:13,043 --> 00:01:16,527
Ok, then I would say let's start proving it.

16
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:20,211
In order to do this let's take the picture from above again.

17
00:01:20,886 --> 00:01:25,280
Let's call the lower bound c_0 and the upper bound d_0.

18
00:01:26,214 --> 00:01:31,429
Now, the overall idea for the whole proof is that we just bisect the interval here.

19
00:01:32,314 --> 00:01:37,857
Then we have 2 intervals, 2 parts and please remember we want to find a subsequence here.

20
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:43,757
Therefore we will continue with the interval that has infinitely many sequence members in it

21
00:01:43,986 --> 00:01:45,403
and ignore the other one.

22
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:52,745
Therefore the procedure is that we first look at the left interval and observe, if we have infinitely many sequence members in it.

23
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:59,552
Of course it could happen that both intervals have infinitely many members in it, but then we would choose the left-hand side.

24
00:02:00,186 --> 00:02:04,802
Ok, so what we get is a new interval that has half the length of the one before.

25
00:02:05,457 --> 00:02:09,012
So either the upper bound or the lower bound changed.

26
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:13,534
Therefore we choose new names, namely c_1 and d_1.

27
00:02:13,734 --> 00:02:17,685
Then maybe not so surprising, we bisect the new interval again

28
00:02:17,885 --> 00:02:22,013
and then we repeat the selecting and the bisecting over and over again.

29
00:02:22,729 --> 00:02:26,067
Hence what we get in the end are nested intervals.

30
00:02:26,814 --> 00:02:35,421
We have our original interval c_0 to d_0 and the new interval c_1 to d_1 is a proper subset of this one

31
00:02:35,957 --> 00:02:41,515
and then after repeating the whole process here, we get the next interval c_2 to d_2.

32
00:02:41,715 --> 00:02:45,936
Which is once again a proper subset of the former interval here.

33
00:02:46,136 --> 00:02:49,490
Hence we have this inclusion as often as we want.

34
00:02:50,014 --> 00:02:55,952
Now the point of the statement is that the length of the interval gets smaller and smaller in each step.

35
00:02:56,857 --> 00:03:05,671
In particular if we calculate (d_1 - c_1), we get 1/2 of the original distance, because we bisected the interval.

36
00:03:06,171 --> 00:03:11,828
In the same way, for (d_2 - c_2) we get 1/2 of (d_1 - c_1)

37
00:03:12,657 --> 00:03:16,059
or in other words 1/4 of the original distance.

38
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:22,102
Ok, by knowing this we can use induction to show the general statement for (d_n - c_n).

39
00:03:22,629 --> 00:03:27,686
We simply get 1/2 to the power n times the length of the original interval

40
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,783
and there you immediately see, this is a nice sequence that converges to 0.

41
00:03:32,983 --> 00:03:39,574
However we also get some information about the sequences d_n and c_n when we look at the picture again.

42
00:03:40,243 --> 00:03:45,924
First of all we know they are bounded sequences, because all the sequence members also lie in this interval

43
00:03:46,329 --> 00:03:52,852
and secondly we know the sequence c_n can only increase, where the sequence d_n can only decrease

44
00:03:53,457 --> 00:03:57,707
and now these things imply that the sequences are also convergent.

45
00:03:58,186 --> 00:04:03,746
Please recall, this is exactly the monotonicity criterion we discussed in former videos.

46
00:04:03,946 --> 00:04:07,400
It's important because we can use it very often, as you can see.

47
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:11,980
What we also can use very often are the limit theorems.

48
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:16,785
From above we can use the fact that we already know this limit, which is 0

49
00:04:16,985 --> 00:04:21,004
and now we have learned that we can push the limit inside the difference.

50
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:24,619
Simply because both limits here also exist.

51
00:04:25,286 --> 00:04:31,074
So please note our conclusion here is that the limits of d_n and c_n are the same.

52
00:04:31,529 --> 00:04:37,181
Therefore finally we are able to define a subsequence for our original sequence a_n.

53
00:04:37,381 --> 00:04:44,010
We simply do that by choosing for a_n_k one of the infinitely many elements inside one of the intervals.

54
00:04:44,514 --> 00:04:49,986
With this we then know that a_n_k lies always between c_k and d_k.

55
00:04:50,686 --> 00:04:55,835
Please recall here again, if we increase k the interval here gets smaller and smaller

56
00:04:56,257 --> 00:05:00,154
and we already know in the limit the boundaries are the same

57
00:05:00,686 --> 00:05:04,935
or to put it in other words here we can now use the sandwich theorem.

58
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:10,827
It simply tells us that the sequence in the middle is also convergent with the same limit

59
00:05:11,027 --> 00:05:14,827
and exactly this limit is our wanted accumulation value.

60
00:05:15,457 --> 00:05:18,187
Now this means that our proof is finished here.

61
00:05:18,614 --> 00:05:21,768
Ok and that's the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem.

62
00:05:22,514 --> 00:05:26,479
Every bounded sequence has at least one accumulation value

63
00:05:27,029 --> 00:05:33,057
and now i can also tell you this statement also holds when you consider sequences of complex numbers.

64
00:05:33,257 --> 00:05:36,290
So it's useful in many different situations.

65
00:05:36,643 --> 00:05:38,676
Ok, I think that's good enough for today.

66
00:05:38,876 --> 00:05:40,065
So I hope I see you next time.

67
00:05:40,265 --> 00:05:41,086
Bye!

Hello and welcome to real analysis.

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:09,150
and as always many, many thanks to all the nice people that support this channel on Steady or Paypal.

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:13,700
In todays part 4 we will talk about the so called limit theorems.

4
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:17,820
Indeed, when you deal with sequences you use them all the time.

5
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,040
For this please recall.

6
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:24,350
This is how we denote a sequence which consists of real number "an"

7
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:28,200
and if the sequence is convergent to a point "a"

8
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:30,490
we have a notation for this limit.

9
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:33,180
One possibility is to write

10
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:37,180
limit "n to infinity" of "an" is equal to "a"

11
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,350
and another possibility is just to use an arrow,

12
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:45,450
where we write "n to infinity" and then it goes to "a"

13
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:48,370
Both things exactly mean the same

14
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:51,180
Namely the definition we gave for convergence.

15
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,710
In this picture you see it again.

16
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:59,450
For all epsilon the sequence members lie inside this epsilon-neighbourhood of "a" eventually.

17
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:03,750
and now we will talk about what happens with the convergence

18
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:06,510
when we combine two convergent sequences.

19
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:10,460
and then we also get some rules how to deal with limits.

20
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:14,480
All of these things we can put into a nice theorem.

21
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:18,460
Lets simply call it the Theorem on limits.

22
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:20,060
This simply means

23
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,760
there exists an uniquely given limit "a" for this sequence

24
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:27,280
and an uniquely given "b" for that sequence.

25
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:31,380
Ok, now maybe lets visualize these sequences with a graph.

26
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:35,740
Therefore for example here we can draw the sequence "an".

27
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:39,900
So this is a1, a2, a3, a4 and so on.

28
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,840
and in the same way we can look at "bn"

29
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:45,340
So b1, b2 and so on.

30
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:48,950
and there you see we can easily form a new sequence

31
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:52,250
just by combining the two sequences here at each point.

32
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:55,420
For example we could just add the values

33
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:57,300
and then we get a new sequence

34
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:58,610
we could call the sum.

35
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:01,280
Now of course the natural question is

36
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:03,390
what happens when "n" goes to infinity?

37
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:07,920
Because we already know we have convergence for "an" and "bn"

38
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:13,270
Therefore it would be nice to have it for "an + bn", the new sequence, as well.

39
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,660
and indeed, this is our first result.

40
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:22,110
We have that the new sequence "an + bn" is again convergent.

41
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,680
So this limit is uniquely defined.

42
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:26,550
But we have even more.

43
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,329
We can immediately calculate it.

44
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:32,270
It's simply the sum of the two limits we already know.

45
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:36,790
In other words we can pull in the limit when we have a sum.

46
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,740
Provided that these two limits here actually exist.

47
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,630
Of course this is what we can use a lot

48
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:47,310
when we want to calculate the limit and we have a plus sign involved.

49
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:52,350
Now the nice thing is this it works exactly the same when have a multiplication sign

50
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:56,660
Also here we can just pull the limit into the product.

51
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:01,020
In other words this new sequence here is also convergent,

52
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:03,600
when we put in two convergent sequences.

53
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,100
Ok. I can tell you the same thing also holds for the inverse operations

54
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,350
namely minus and division.

55
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:15,900
So maybe lets write that down for the new sequence given by this fraction.

56
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,500
Of course there we have to put in that the denominator is never 0

57
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,990
such that this whole fraction is well defined.

58
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:28,079
But then we can just write the limit in the numerator and denominator

59
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:31,490
provided that this limit here is also not 0.

60
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:36,560
However under these two assumptions we get the same result as for the product.

61
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,730
Ok, with this we have the 3 important limit theorems.

62
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,170
You really should remember.

63
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:47,180
We can simply prove them by using our epsilon, "N" definition as always.

64
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:51,860
Since the proof works in a similar way as we have done it for other proofs before

65
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:53,280
i can just skip it here.

66
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,040
However it's really not so hard so we better use the time for a typical example.

67
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:03,060
So lets take this new sequence "Cn" given by this fraction for all "n"

68
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,750
and ask the question

69
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:07,150
is this one a convergent sequence?

70
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,850
and if yes, what is the limit?

71
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:12,740
At first glance this is not clear at all,

72
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,000
because we don't have the form from above.

73
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,720
We don't have a convergent sequence here or here.

74
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:22,740
Indeed if "n" increases this number here gets larger and larger

75
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:26,250
However what you should see is that the term with "n^2"

76
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:28,850
is the most important part for this growth.

77
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,820
In other words if "n" is very large

78
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,350
only these two parts here are important for the whole calculation.

79
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,400
Therefore the question remains

80
00:04:37,409 --> 00:04:39,780
how can we deal with this in the correct way.

81
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,400
In fact this always works the same 

82
00:04:42,409 --> 00:04:46,320
we just have to expand the whole fraction by this highest power.

83
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:52,850
Hence in this case just the multiply numerator and denominator by 1 over "n^2"

84
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,800
Then you see everything cancels out 

85
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:58,600
and we get out sequences we already know.

86
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:00,860
So here constant 2 

87
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,800
then 5 over "n" and 

88
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:04,310
-1 over "n^2"

89
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:07,370
and similarly in the denominator.

90
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:13,150
Now please recall we have already shown that 1 over "n" goes to 0.

91
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:16,270
So it's convergent with limit 0.

92
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:19,690
Then by using the limit theorem part b 

93
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:22,950
we also know that 1 over "n^2" goes to 0.

94
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,340
Therefore by combining all the limit theorems

95
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,890
we see that these parts here all go to 0.

96
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:34,400
and the only thing that remains in the limit is 2 divided by -5.

97
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:40,440
More concretely here after the limit we get 2 + 0 - 0

98
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:44,050
and here -5 + 0 + 0.

99
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:48,950
Hence -2 over 5 is indeed the limit of "Cn"

100
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:54,260
To put it into other words we have proven that this sequence is indeed convergent

101
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,659
without using the definition with epsilon and "N".

102
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:02,220
Hence you see the limit theorems make your life much easier here.

103
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,020
Now besides all these properties 

104
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:08,110
the limit also fulfills a monotonicity property

105
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:12,360
also this is then very helpful for actually calculating limits.

106
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:17,320
Therefore i show you that in the next video and then we consider more examples.

107
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:20,470
Therefore i hope i see you there and have a nice day.

108
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:21,370
Bye!

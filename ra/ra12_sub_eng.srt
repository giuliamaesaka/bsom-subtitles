Hello and welcome back to real analysis

2
00:00:03,929 --> 00:00:08,892
and of course many, many thanks to all the nice people that support this channel on Steady or Paypal.

3
00:00:09,092 --> 00:00:13,626
In today's part 12 we talk again about the limit superior and the limit inferior.

4
00:00:14,386 --> 00:00:20,489
Here please recall, for any sequence of real numbers this lim sup and lim inf always exist.

5
00:00:20,771 --> 00:00:25,841
Namely they are either a real number or the symbol - or + infinity.

6
00:00:26,041 --> 00:00:30,117
Also I can tell you, some people write this set as an interval.

7
00:00:30,657 --> 00:00:36,738
There we use brackets to say that the symbols -infinity and infinity are included in the set.

8
00:00:36,938 --> 00:00:40,899
Ok, since you already know this, let's look at an example.

9
00:00:41,343 --> 00:00:47,739
So here i take the sequence a_n given as (-1) to the power n times n.

10
00:00:47,939 --> 00:00:56,516
Hence the sequence starts with -1, then comes 2, then -3, then 4, -5 and so on.

11
00:00:57,014 --> 00:01:00,442
Obviously this sequence is not convergent.

12
00:01:00,642 --> 00:01:04,978
However we find a subsequence that is divergent to infinity.

13
00:01:05,178 --> 00:01:08,323
Hence the lim sup has to be infinity.

14
00:01:08,757 --> 00:01:13,693
Then in the same way we find a subsequence that is divergent to -infinity.

15
00:01:14,286 --> 00:01:17,419
Hence the lim inf has to be -infinity.

16
00:01:17,957 --> 00:01:20,043
So you see this is a simple example,

17
00:01:20,086 --> 00:01:27,271
but it tells us that all the elements in this set are possible values for the limit superior and limit inferior.

18
00:01:27,871 --> 00:01:30,884
With this in mind let's formulate some properties.

19
00:01:31,343 --> 00:01:34,806
First let's discuss what we have for convergent sequences.

20
00:01:35,257 --> 00:01:41,410
Here please recall, the lim sup is the largest accumulation value and the lim inf the smallest one.

21
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:48,036
Therefore a sequence is convergent if and only if the lim sup and the lim inf are actually the same

22
00:01:48,236 --> 00:01:50,968
and of course they should be real numbers.

23
00:01:51,429 --> 00:01:57,106
This is not hard to see, if the sequence is convergent lim sup and lim inf are actually the limit.

24
00:01:57,306 --> 00:02:05,214
On the other hand if they are the same, there is only one accumulation value, therefore the sequence has to converge to this value.

25
00:02:05,414 --> 00:02:10,970
Ok, now we can extend this result and talk about the case when the limit is infinity.

26
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:14,419
So we say the sequence is divergent to infinity.

27
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:19,799
Then lim sup and lim inf have to be the same again, but now they should be infinity.

28
00:02:20,686 --> 00:02:27,593
Please compare this to the example, because there it's different. They are not real numbers, but they are not the same.

29
00:02:27,793 --> 00:02:35,053
Ok, another thing i can tell you is that the lim sup is always the largest accumulation value. So always larger than lim inf.

30
00:02:35,253 --> 00:02:37,643
Therefore we can just ignore this part here.

31
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,966
This immediately follows if you know that the lim inf is infinity.

32
00:02:42,514 --> 00:02:48,044
Now next, maybe not so surprising, we can do the same for the limit -infinity

33
00:02:48,244 --> 00:02:53,068
and this holds if and only if the lim sup is -infinity.

34
00:02:53,814 --> 00:02:59,916
Now, all the things here are easy to show, when you know the definitions we discussed in the last video.

35
00:03:00,429 --> 00:03:05,629
A little bit more complicated is the next property, where we combine 2 different sequences.

36
00:03:06,371 --> 00:03:12,286
Ok, now for a sequence a_n and b_n you could ask: "What is the lim sup of the sum?"

37
00:03:12,686 --> 00:03:15,252
So lim sup (a_n + b_n).

38
00:03:15,452 --> 00:03:20,020
In general this is not equal to the sum of the two limit superiors,

39
00:03:20,729 --> 00:03:22,989
but only less or equal.

40
00:03:23,686 --> 00:03:29,912
However please keep in mind, this only makes sense if the right-hand side here, is well defined.

41
00:03:30,286 --> 00:03:35,638
For example infinity + (-infinity) would be not defined.

42
00:03:36,029 --> 00:03:43,995
Now, this is the only exception of this inequality. For example you could have infinity + 5 and this would be infinity again.

43
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,882
Ok, now in the same way, for 2 sequences you could ask: "What is about the product?"

44
00:03:50,082 --> 00:03:58,833
and it turns out, it's the same thing. The lim sup of (a_n times b_n) is less or equal than the product of the 2 limit superiors.

45
00:03:59,214 --> 00:04:06,816
However, in general this is not correct, because we could have different signs for the sequences, which would flip the inequality.

46
00:04:07,314 --> 00:04:12,361
Therefore let's formulate and remember this property for non-negative sequences.

47
00:04:12,857 --> 00:04:19,574
However also here we have an exception, for example 0 times infinity is not defined.

48
00:04:19,774 --> 00:04:25,178
This is important to know, whenever you calculate with the symbols - and + infinity.

49
00:04:25,771 --> 00:04:30,751
Ok, i would say proving these two inequalities is a very good exercise for you,

50
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:37,392
because when you do this, you immediately see that we have a similar inequality for the limit inferior.

51
00:04:37,829 --> 00:04:42,972
So it's the same in green here. The only thing that changed is the direction of the inequality.

52
00:04:43,172 --> 00:04:47,420
So the lim inf on the left-hand side could get bigger than the right-hand side.

53
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:53,315
To see that this is in general really an inequality let's look at an example.

54
00:04:53,971 --> 00:04:57,076
So here we need two sequences of real numbers.

55
00:04:57,657 --> 00:05:03,093
I want a_n to be 1, -1, 1, -1 and so on

56
00:05:03,293 --> 00:05:07,907
and b_n to be 0, 2, 0, 2 and so on.

57
00:05:08,329 --> 00:05:12,736
With this information we can immediately calculate the sum of the two sequences.

58
00:05:13,371 --> 00:05:17,514
Which is simply the constant sequence with value 1.

59
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,943
Hence simply a convergent sequence.

60
00:05:20,857 --> 00:05:25,483
Therefore the lim sup and the lim inf of the sum are simply 1

61
00:05:25,683 --> 00:05:30,010
and now we know from the properties above that we have inequalities here.

62
00:05:30,386 --> 00:05:33,852
Indeed, here in this case they are actually strict,

63
00:05:34,052 --> 00:05:39,035
because here on the right-hand side we have 1 + 2, which is 3.

64
00:05:39,235 --> 00:05:41,801
Which is strictly greater than 1

65
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:49,817
and for the lim inf, we have -1 + 0. So also here strictly less than 1.

66
00:05:50,386 --> 00:05:54,077
Ok, now of course we can do the same for the product.

67
00:05:54,277 --> 00:05:57,476
However, for this we should take non-negative sequences.

68
00:05:57,943 --> 00:06:01,415
Therefore let's formulate this with a new example.

69
00:06:01,943 --> 00:06:08,627
So we can take the same sequence for b_n, but for a_n we have to substitute -1 with 0.

70
00:06:09,014 --> 00:06:14,266
Then the product sequence is just the constant sequence, now with 0 as the value.

71
00:06:14,729 --> 00:06:18,221
Of course then the lim sup is 0 as well.

72
00:06:18,421 --> 00:06:24,465
On the other hand the lim sup of a_n is 1 and the lim sup of b_n is 2.

73
00:06:24,665 --> 00:06:27,071
So we have 2 on the right-hand side.

74
00:06:27,686 --> 00:06:32,576
Therefore also here, we see in this example we have the strict inequality.

75
00:06:33,314 --> 00:06:40,956
Ok, after all this the important things you really should remember are the 4 inequalities we have for lim sup and lim inf

76
00:06:41,414 --> 00:06:47,069
and when you have time, maybe you also find an example, where we have the strict inequality for lim inf.

77
00:06:47,571 --> 00:06:52,604
Later you will see, we can use these inequalities a lot in calculations.

78
00:06:53,157 --> 00:06:56,733
Ok, I think that's good enough for today and I hope I see you next time.

79
00:06:56,814 --> 00:06:57,543
Bye!

Hello and welcome back to real analysis

2
00:00:04,257 --> 00:00:08,025
and first I want to thank all the nice supporters on Steady or Paypal.

3
00:00:08,225 --> 00:00:13,506
In today's part 15 we will talk about infinite sums, also called series.

4
00:00:13,706 --> 00:00:19,675
Indeed this is such an important topic that we will use the next videos to talk about all the details.

5
00:00:20,043 --> 00:00:25,581
Here we just start how we can define infinite sum in a rigorous way

6
00:00:25,986 --> 00:00:30,762
and in the end you will see this is not so new. A series is just a special sequence

7
00:00:31,143 --> 00:00:34,612
and how you deal with sequences, you have already learned here.

8
00:00:35,443 --> 00:00:41,126
Ok, now in some problems it can occur that we need to add up infinitely many numbers.

9
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:48,463
For example we have the number a_1, then we add a_2, then a_3, a_4 and so on.

10
00:00:49,014 --> 00:00:57,029
To make this shorter you could say, let's use the sum symbol, the capital Sigma, where we go from k = 1 to infinity.

11
00:00:57,229 --> 00:01:02,376
This is then what we call a series. So just adding infinitely many numbers.

12
00:01:02,814 --> 00:01:07,342
So you see this is not so complicated. So let's immediately look at an example.

13
00:01:07,886 --> 00:01:11,876
The only thing we need here is a sequence a_k of real numbers.

14
00:01:12,429 --> 00:01:17,548
Therefore let's take one we already know. Which is -1 to the power k.

15
00:01:18,114 --> 00:01:21,975
So this is a well defined sequence. However not a convergent one.

16
00:01:22,271 --> 00:01:26,768
Nevertheless we still could ask: "What is the infinite sum of this sequence?"

17
00:01:27,471 --> 00:01:31,271
Here we know, we start wit -1 and then we add 1

18
00:01:31,471 --> 00:01:34,562
and then afterwards we add -1 again

19
00:01:35,243 --> 00:01:38,500
and then 1 again, then -1 again and so on.

20
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:47,854
Of course this is what we can easily calculate, because we can set parentheses here and here and then we see, we just add zeros.

21
00:01:48,471 --> 00:01:52,604
Hence the result of this infinite sum should be 0 as well.

22
00:01:53,086 --> 00:01:57,741
Ok, at this point you should ask: "Why do we set the parentheses in this way?"

23
00:01:57,941 --> 00:02:00,892
Of course there are also other possible ways.

24
00:02:01,529 --> 00:02:06,917
For example we could skip the first element -1 and set the parentheses here.

25
00:02:07,117 --> 00:02:11,262
Then we still add zeros, but what remains is -1.

26
00:02:11,657 --> 00:02:15,345
Ok, now we have 2 different possible results.

27
00:02:15,829 --> 00:02:19,987
So we immediately see such infinite sums here make problems.

28
00:02:20,187 --> 00:02:24,288
So we need to define them and they don't act like normal sums at all,

29
00:02:25,129 --> 00:02:28,794
because in a normal sum we can set the parentheses as we want

30
00:02:29,571 --> 00:02:34,895
and at the moment we don't know in which cases we are allowed to this for an infinite sum as well.

31
00:02:35,186 --> 00:02:41,409
This might be a little bit confusing, because we use the same symbol, but we could have different calculation rules.

32
00:02:42,286 --> 00:02:46,479
Therefore first let's define the symbol in a mathematical way.

33
00:02:46,986 --> 00:02:49,627
So this will be our definition of a series.

34
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,022
For this let a_k be any sequence of real numbers

35
00:02:54,486 --> 00:03:03,874
and then we define a new sequence s_n by setting s_n to be the sum of the first n members of the sequence a_k.

36
00:03:04,343 --> 00:03:07,465
So this is just a normal finite sum.

37
00:03:07,665 --> 00:03:10,263
Hence s_n is a real number as well.

38
00:03:10,463 --> 00:03:15,063
Therefore the whole sequence given by s_n is what we call the series

39
00:03:15,514 --> 00:03:21,558
and now you should see, in the case that this sequence is convergent we have a meaning for the infinite sum.

40
00:03:21,957 --> 00:03:27,587
Therefore we are also able to define the symbol, where we have infinity at the sum here.

41
00:03:28,129 --> 00:03:32,420
So this is simply the limit n to infinity of s_n

42
00:03:32,986 --> 00:03:38,387
or without using a new name you would simply say it's the limit of these partial sums.

43
00:03:38,587 --> 00:03:42,361
Ok, there we have the case that often leads to confusion.

44
00:03:42,561 --> 00:03:46,567
Namely this symbol here is frequently used in 2 different meanings.

45
00:03:47,243 --> 00:03:51,235
On the one hand you can use it for the whole sequence s_n,

46
00:03:51,435 --> 00:03:54,370
because then you don't need to introduce a new name

47
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:59,228
and on the other hand it's also used for the limit, if it exists.

48
00:03:59,428 --> 00:04:04,953
Therefore please be careful. Sometimes you are allowed to calculate with this symbol as a number,

49
00:04:05,471 --> 00:04:09,066
but other times such a calculation can lead to contradictions.

50
00:04:09,543 --> 00:04:16,000
Ok, so that's the definition and the introduction for a series and in the next video I will show you an example.

51
00:04:16,117 --> 00:04:18,786
Namely the important geometric series.

52
00:04:19,271 --> 00:04:22,941
Hence a good transition would be to rewrite our example from above.

53
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:26,372
Let's formulate this into the sequence of partial sums.

54
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,286
There a_k is -1 to the power k.

55
00:04:30,886 --> 00:04:34,618
Now let's write the sum here as a sequence with index n.

56
00:04:34,818 --> 00:04:41,227
There for calculating the first member we put in the index n = 1 and get out -1.

57
00:04:41,427 --> 00:04:48,400
Then for the next member we have n = 2. Which means we have -1 + 1 and we get 0

58
00:04:49,086 --> 00:04:52,546
and then for n = 3 we get -1 again.

59
00:04:53,271 --> 00:04:56,102
Then this simply repeats with this pattern

60
00:04:56,571 --> 00:04:59,650
and here you know, this sequence is not convergent.

61
00:05:00,229 --> 00:05:04,421
Ok, maybe for closing this video also another example would be helpful.

62
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:10,345
Ok, here I want to ask the question: "What happens when we put in +1 instead of -1?"

63
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,830
Of course then the power k does not matter at all, because we always get out 1.

64
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:22,852
Therefore for our sequence of partial sums we get out 1, then 2, then 3 and so on.

65
00:05:23,143 --> 00:05:27,154
Obviously this is also a sequence that is not convergent.

66
00:05:27,543 --> 00:05:30,880
However we could say it's divergent to infinity.

67
00:05:31,257 --> 00:05:36,137
Now I already told you that in the next video we will talk about the geometric series.

68
00:05:36,857 --> 00:05:42,257
This will generalize these 2 examples, but then we will also get convergent series.

69
00:05:42,859 --> 00:05:46,371
Therefore I hope I see you there and have a nice day! Bye!

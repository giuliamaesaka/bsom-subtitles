Hello and welcome back to real analysis

2
00:00:04,214 --> 00:00:09,751
and as always many, many thanks to all the nice people that support this channel on Steady or Paypal.

3
00:00:10,471 --> 00:00:15,429
This part 8 today is about an example, where we can do some concrete calculations.

4
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:21,152
In particular i want to show you how we can apply this fact, we introduced in the last video.

5
00:00:21,871 --> 00:00:26,153
This is one important criterion you can use to check for convergence.

6
00:00:26,571 --> 00:00:32,272
You just have to show that the sequence is monotonically decreasing and also bounded from below.

7
00:00:32,686 --> 00:00:35,385
In a similar way this works the other way around.

8
00:00:35,585 --> 00:00:43,442
So if you can show that the sequence is monotonically increasing and also bounded from above, then the sequence is also convergent.

9
00:00:44,314 --> 00:00:48,646
Now, both things we can just call the "monotone convergence criterion".

10
00:00:49,371 --> 00:00:54,415
Ok, now the video is about how to use this criterion for an example.

11
00:00:55,057 --> 00:01:00,697
Indeed this example is a very important one, because it has a very special limit.

12
00:01:01,014 --> 00:01:08,065
So here the sequence a_n is given by "(1 + 1/n) to the power n".

13
00:01:08,786 --> 00:01:14,445
In order to show that this is indeed a convergent sequence, we can use the criterion from above.

14
00:01:15,114 --> 00:01:20,234
Hence we have to show 2 seperate properties and we start with the monotonicity.

15
00:01:20,757 --> 00:01:28,613
Ok, there i can give you the hint: often it is helpful to consider the fraction "a_n+1 divided by a_n"

16
00:01:28,813 --> 00:01:35,131
and then you can see if this is less or equal than 1, this sequence is monotonically decreasing.

17
00:01:35,914 --> 00:01:41,873
On the other hand if the fraction is greater or equal than 1, this sequence is monotonically increasing.

18
00:01:42,414 --> 00:01:45,770
So for this reason lets analyse this fraction.

19
00:01:46,071 --> 00:01:55,137
In the first step by just putting in the definition, we immediately see we have in the numerator the power n+1 and in the denominator the power n.

20
00:01:55,337 --> 00:01:58,602
Therefore the first idea would be to adjust that.

21
00:01:59,129 --> 00:02:06,028
One possibility would be to increase the power in the denominator, but then we have to cancel this out with the same factor.

22
00:02:06,829 --> 00:02:10,094
Ok, with this you should see we didn't change anything.

23
00:02:10,857 --> 00:02:14,781
Then in the next step i want to pull the power out of the fraction,

24
00:02:15,557 --> 00:02:23,077
because now we can easily work inside the parentheses and get rid of all the fractions inside the large fraction.

25
00:02:23,657 --> 00:02:28,641
In order to do this we just expand the fraction by a factor "n times (n+1)".

26
00:02:29,471 --> 00:02:33,020
There you can just do the multiplication and then we get the following.

27
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:37,129
In the numerator we have "n times (n +1) + n"

28
00:02:37,244 --> 00:02:41,171
but in the denominator we also have + 1 at the end.

29
00:02:41,857 --> 00:02:47,513
Therefore we can just add the missing 1 in the numerator as well, if we subtract it immediately.

30
00:02:47,929 --> 00:02:53,322
Of course the advantage now is that we can split this fraction into 2 simple fractions.

31
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:57,844
The first is just the number 1, because it nicely cancels out

32
00:02:58,044 --> 00:03:01,499
and the second is -1 divided by the denominator.

33
00:03:01,943 --> 00:03:07,925
Indeed simplifying this denominator gets us "n^2 + 2n + 1"

34
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:11,898
and you should know this is simply (n + 1) squared.

35
00:03:12,714 --> 00:03:17,062
Now in the next step we use something that is called "Bernoulli's inequality".

36
00:03:17,571 --> 00:03:24,829
It tells us that for natural numbers k and real numbers greater or equal than -1 we have

37
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:31,520
that we can transform the power k to a multiplication and then we get something that is less or equal.

38
00:03:31,957 --> 00:03:35,802
This statement here you can easily show by using induction

39
00:03:36,514 --> 00:03:40,702
and then we can use it to estimate any powers we have of this form.

40
00:03:41,343 --> 00:03:47,498
In our case we use it for this factor here, where the power is n + 1 and this is our x.

41
00:03:47,698 --> 00:03:55,777
Hence the whole thing is greater or equal than when we have here, "1 + (n + 1) times our x".

42
00:03:56,286 --> 00:03:59,842
Which is -1 divided by (n + 1) squared.

43
00:04:00,571 --> 00:04:03,741
Hence you see this (n+1) here cancels out.

44
00:04:04,529 --> 00:04:08,308
Ok, after this we can just put both factors here together.

45
00:04:08,657 --> 00:04:13,974
The first factor we can just rewrite as (n + 1) divided by n.

46
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:20,235
and in the same way the second factor is "(n + 1) - 1" divided by (n + 1).

47
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:26,408
and there you see in the numerator we have + 1 and -1, so in sum just 0.

48
00:04:27,286 --> 00:04:30,724
Hence we can just cancel all the factors here.

49
00:04:31,486 --> 00:04:34,695
Which leads us to a simple number 1.

50
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:41,776
Therefore with this we have shown that this fraction here is greater or equal than 1.

51
00:04:42,386 --> 00:04:48,837
This holds for all n. So we have shown that the sequence a_n is indeed monotonically increasing.

52
00:04:49,443 --> 00:04:54,437
Hence in the second part now, we show that the second is also bounded from above.

53
00:04:55,014 --> 00:05:00,563
Showing this is indeed a good exercise, because i can explain the binomial theorem.

54
00:05:01,086 --> 00:05:04,567
It tells us that we can write this binomial as a sum.

55
00:05:05,214 --> 00:05:09,603
The sum starts for k = 0 and goes until n.

56
00:05:09,803 --> 00:05:13,782
Then comes the binomial coefficient n over k 

57
00:05:14,371 --> 00:05:20,814
and then the first entry to the power (n - k) times the second entry to the power k.

58
00:05:21,171 --> 00:05:26,713
Hence in our case this looks very simple, because 1 stays 1, no matter what the power is.

59
00:05:27,329 --> 00:05:32,133
Ok in order to get an idea what this sum means, lets calculate the first 2 terms here.

60
00:05:32,643 --> 00:05:40,701
So we have n choose 0 as a binomial coefficient times 1 to the power n times 1/n to the power 0.

61
00:05:41,129 --> 00:05:45,440
Then the second term is the same with k = 1

62
00:05:45,943 --> 00:05:49,315
and then for all the other terms we just write a sum again.

63
00:05:49,629 --> 00:05:53,139
Ok, then lets discuss all the different factors we have here.

64
00:05:53,886 --> 00:05:58,487
Now by definition you should know that n choose 0 is just 1

65
00:05:58,687 --> 00:06:01,424
and the same by definition for the power 0.

66
00:06:02,171 --> 00:06:05,342
Therefore the first part in the sum is just the number 1.

67
00:06:05,986 --> 00:06:10,700
In the second part we have n choose 1, which is by definition n

68
00:06:11,114 --> 00:06:14,525
and also 1/n. So they cancel out.

69
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:19,365
In other words also for the second part in the sum we have the number 1.

70
00:06:20,043 --> 00:06:24,756
Hence we only need to discuss what happens with the rest of the sum. So the third part here.

71
00:06:25,414 --> 00:06:30,105
For this it might be helpful to recall the definition of the binomial coefficient.

72
00:06:30,514 --> 00:06:39,512
Indeed n choose k is given by n! divided by "(n - k)! times k!.

73
00:06:40,114 --> 00:06:46,191
Now the idea is that we combine this with the second factor, which is 1/n to the power k.

74
00:06:46,729 --> 00:06:49,832
Therefore lets put these three factors together.

75
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:56,880
Now n! is nothing else then "n times (n - 1) times (n - 2) and so on.

76
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:05,058
However, if we divide it by (n - k)!, we reach an end point here. Which is (n - k + 1).

77
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:13,981
Now what you should see is, that we have exactly k factors here. Therefore n to the power k, we also can write as a product.

78
00:07:14,471 --> 00:07:18,562
Then each factor in the numerator gets an n in the denominator

79
00:07:18,914 --> 00:07:24,718
and then we can conclude that each pair we put together here is less or equal than 1.

80
00:07:25,557 --> 00:07:28,929
Therefore the whole fraction here is less or equal than 1.

81
00:07:29,743 --> 00:07:36,541
Hence we have a nice estimate. We can just say that the whole thing is less or equal than 1/k!

82
00:07:37,043 --> 00:07:44,073
and because we started a sum for k = 2, we can also estimate this 1/k!.

83
00:07:44,614 --> 00:07:48,346
We just stop the factorial product after 2 steps,

84
00:07:48,546 --> 00:07:53,298
because we divide by a smaller number than, we just get out a bigger number.

85
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:58,257
Then in the last step we just expand this fraction into 2 fractions.

86
00:07:59,086 --> 00:08:02,810
We simply have 1/(k - 1) - 1/k.

87
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,211
Please check that this is indeed equal.

88
00:08:06,411 --> 00:08:11,227
Ok, then calculating the sum for these 2 fractions is very simple.

89
00:08:11,427 --> 00:08:15,061
Because this is what some people call a telescoping sum.

90
00:08:15,714 --> 00:08:20,995
You see there is just one index shift and therefore in the sum a lot of things cancel out.

91
00:08:21,529 --> 00:08:29,264
Indeed only 2 things remain, namely the first part here for k = 2 and the last part here for k = n.

92
00:08:29,464 --> 00:08:33,055
In other words we have 1 - 1/n.

93
00:08:33,255 --> 00:08:38,937
Ok, now putting all these things together, we can use it to estimate our a_n here.

94
00:08:39,814 --> 00:08:44,613
So it's less or equal than 2 + 1 - 1/n.

95
00:08:45,357 --> 00:08:49,622
In summary a_n is less or equal than 3.

96
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:54,283
Therefore in fact the sequence a_n is bounded from above.

97
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,758
Ok and together with the monotonicity we have that the sequence is actually convergent

98
00:09:01,357 --> 00:09:05,250
and there you see how helpful the monotone convergence criterion can be.

99
00:09:06,271 --> 00:09:12,854
We didn't need to calculate the limit, we just showed that the sequence is convergent without using the limit.

100
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:18,135
However now we know that this limit exists and it gets a special name.

101
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:22,288
It's simply called e, which stands for Euler's number

102
00:09:23,014 --> 00:09:28,505
and indeed the whole proof showed here, that Euler's number has to be between 2 and 3,

103
00:09:29,214 --> 00:09:33,509
but of course about the number e we will talk a lot in this course later.

104
00:09:34,114 --> 00:09:38,937
However before we do this we need to explain more details about sequences first

105
00:09:39,529 --> 00:09:42,253
and that's what we do in the next video.

106
00:09:42,453 --> 00:09:46,015
Therefore i hope i see you there and have a nice day. Bye!

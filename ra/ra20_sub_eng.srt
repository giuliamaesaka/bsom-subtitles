00:00:00,471 --> 00:00:03,655
Hello and welcome back to real analysis

2
00:00:03,855 --> 00:00:09,381
and as always many, many thanks to all the nice people that support this channel on Steady or PayPal.

3
00:00:10,071 --> 00:00:17,494
In today's part 20 we will talk about two important criteria we have for the convergence or the divergence of a series.

4
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:21,921
They are simply called the ratio test and the root test

5
00:00:22,214 --> 00:00:28,290
In the best case scenario they answer the question if a given series is absolutely convergent.

6
00:00:28,586 --> 00:00:31,676
Here please recall we have already learned in the last video,

7
00:00:31,876 --> 00:00:36,486
if we have a convergent majorant,  this series is absolutely convergent.

8
00:00:36,791 --> 00:00:39,391
This is known as the comparison test.

9
00:00:39,914 --> 00:00:43,987
The only problem here is that we really have to find such a majorant.

10
00:00:44,443 --> 00:00:49,376
Therefore we might try to use some series, where we already know that they are convergent.

11
00:00:49,771 --> 00:00:53,744
For example we already know the famous geometric series.

12
00:00:53,944 --> 00:00:58,857
As a reminder let's state the fact again, which holds for the geometric series.

13
00:00:59,057 --> 00:01:08,566
We know that summing up the powers of q gives us a convergence series, if and only if this q is in the absolute value less than 1.

14
00:01:08,766 --> 00:01:15,166
We need this fact for real numbers q, but I can tell you it also holds for complex numbers q.

15
00:01:15,729 --> 00:01:20,109
This is good to know in the case that you also watch my complex analysis course.

16
00:01:20,309 --> 00:01:25,750
Ok, now here we will apply the comparison test by using the geometric series

17
00:01:26,214 --> 00:01:29,231
and let's put all of this in a proposition.

18
00:01:29,586 --> 00:01:36,000
So if we find an index n_0 and a number q, which is in the absolute value less than 1

19
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:45,814
and with the property that the absolute value of a_k is less than q to the power k, for all k greater or equal than n_0,

20
00:01:46,114 --> 00:01:50,051
then this series a_k is absolutely convergent.

21
00:01:50,251 --> 00:01:53,954
This is simply the majorant criterion from the last video

22
00:01:54,229 --> 00:01:58,755
and we just use the convergent geometric series for the majorant.

23
00:01:59,214 --> 00:02:06,239
Ok, we can change it a little bit, because we don't destroy the convergence when we multiply the series with a constant.

24
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:12,273
Therefore we can simply introduce a constant capital C here and we have the same result.

25
00:02:12,473 --> 00:02:18,717
Now again this is simply the majorant criterion which might be helpful if you want to check for convergence.

26
00:02:19,157 --> 00:02:24,456
Still here you have to find a suitable q such that this inequality is fulfilled.

27
00:02:24,656 --> 00:02:29,226
Therefore it might be psychologically helpful to rewrite the whole thing

28
00:02:29,426 --> 00:02:33,662
and one possibility leads us to something we call the ratio test.

29
00:02:34,171 --> 00:02:42,551
There we just have to calculate a quotient. Namely we just take a_(k+1) and divide it by a_k

30
00:02:42,751 --> 00:02:52,097
and if this is measured with the absolute value, less or equal than q for all k, then the series is absolutely convergent.

31
00:02:52,543 --> 00:03:00,750
For some examples this can be very helpful when you can calculate this fraction or when you can estimate it very easily.

32
00:03:01,143 --> 00:03:07,151
Of course for the correct formulation here, we have to choose our n_0 again and the number q.

33
00:03:07,351 --> 00:03:12,814
In order to make this formulation simpler we can just choose q between 0 and 1,

34
00:03:13,014 --> 00:03:16,372
because obviously a negative q won't work here.

35
00:03:16,943 --> 00:03:19,998
However please keep in mind, 1 is excluded here.

36
00:03:20,686 --> 00:03:26,594
Ok, so we want this inequality here eventually, so for all k greater or equal than n_0.

37
00:03:27,186 --> 00:03:33,059
However we can only have that if the denominator here is always non-zero.

38
00:03:33,571 --> 00:03:37,298
Hence to be correct we have to include this information here as well.

39
00:03:37,857 --> 00:03:43,649
Now before we do an example let me show you the proof of the ratio test, which is very short.

40
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:46,771
Indeed we have already all the information we need.

41
00:03:47,329 --> 00:03:52,133
In the first step let's multiply this inequality with the denominator.

42
00:03:52,657 --> 00:03:58,302
Then we get this nice inequality which holds for all k greater or equal than n_0.

43
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:04,002
This means we can apply it again on the right-hand side, where we have the absolute value of a_k.

44
00:04:04,557 --> 00:04:08,642
In other words we have here q times a_(k-1)

45
00:04:08,842 --> 00:04:14,251
and then we can do this again and again until this index here is n_0

46
00:04:14,814 --> 00:04:20,158
I just say you can do this inductively, because the formal proof would be a proof by induction.

47
00:04:20,571 --> 00:04:26,193
Ok and here we just have to count how many steps we have. So how many factors q we have

48
00:04:26,393 --> 00:04:29,800
and it turns out we have k+1-n_0.

49
00:04:30,286 --> 00:04:35,664
Of course we can just rewrite this if you want with the correct factor k+1.

50
00:04:35,864 --> 00:04:39,247
Simply by dividing with q to the power n_0.

51
00:04:39,629 --> 00:04:43,923
There you see both things together gives us this power back.

52
00:04:44,123 --> 00:04:51,352
We do this because now this whole inequality, left-hand side and right-hand side is of this form here.

53
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,243
Where our constant c is simply this fraction here.

54
00:04:55,971 --> 00:05:02,796
However this whole thing now means that all the requirements of the majorant criterion are satisfied.

55
00:05:03,357 --> 00:05:09,433
Hence we can conclude that the series is absolutely convergent and we have proven the ratio test.

56
00:05:10,129 --> 00:05:14,793
Ok, so now let's demonstrate how helpful this test can be with an example.

57
00:05:14,993 --> 00:05:19,688
Here let's consider the series with 1 over k factorial.

58
00:05:20,214 --> 00:05:24,078
The question for you is now: "Is this a convergent series?".

59
00:05:24,743 --> 00:05:30,162
Now, because there is a fraction involved, maybe the ratio test gives immediately an answer.

60
00:05:30,657 --> 00:05:34,039
Therefore I would say just let's calculate this fraction here.

61
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:38,876
We just have positive numbers. Therefore we can omit the absolute values.

62
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:45,395
Ok, so this is the fraction and now we can use, that we know what (k+1) factorial is.

63
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:49,592
It is simply k factorial multiplied with (k+1).

64
00:05:49,829 --> 00:05:54,869
This means that everything cancels out here, except one factor, k+1

65
00:05:55,069 --> 00:05:58,667
and the crucial thing here is, it's in the denominator.

66
00:05:59,243 --> 00:06:03,975
Therefore we immediately see, this is always less or equal than 1/2.

67
00:06:04,629 --> 00:06:09,736
Hence this 1/2 is our q and n_0 we can choose as 1.

68
00:06:09,936 --> 00:06:15,450
Of course if you would choose a larger n_0, you could choose a smaller q.

69
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:21,193
However this is not important. The important thing is that you can choose q less than 1 

70
00:06:21,393 --> 00:06:23,944
and of course 1/2 is a good choice here.

71
00:06:24,514 --> 00:06:29,293
Ok and there you see, we are already finished. This series is convergent.

72
00:06:29,493 --> 00:06:35,634
Now, before we go to the next test, I should warn you that you really should be careful in your calculations.

73
00:06:36,286 --> 00:06:41,930
If you just show that this fraction is strictly less than 1, this is not enough!

74
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:48,301
Of course it looks similar to the inequality we want, but please note it's not the same

75
00:06:48,501 --> 00:06:51,628
and also, you already know a good example for this.

76
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,314
Namely the harmonic series. Which is divergent.

77
00:06:55,929 --> 00:07:01,337
Ok with this in mind let's go to another important test, the root test.

78
00:07:01,729 --> 00:07:06,788
As the name suggests, here we don't look at a ratio as before, but at a root.

79
00:07:07,314 --> 00:07:12,249
More concretely we will look at the kth root of a_k in the absolute value

80
00:07:13,014 --> 00:07:17,264
and as before this should be less or equal than a given q

81
00:07:17,464 --> 00:07:21,868
and the overall assumptions for q are of course the same as before

82
00:07:22,386 --> 00:07:26,580
and then we can conclude that the series is absolutely convergent.

83
00:07:27,229 --> 00:07:32,754
Here you see unlike the ratio test, the root test does not need that a_k is non-zero.

84
00:07:33,243 --> 00:07:36,255
In this sense we have fewer assumptions here.

85
00:07:36,455 --> 00:07:42,717
Ok, then let's write down the proof, but I can tell you, it's probably the simplest proof we have ever done in this course,

86
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:48,367
because in this inequality we can simply use the kth power on both sides

87
00:07:49,086 --> 00:07:54,575
and then we simply have that q to the power k is a majorant for a_k

88
00:07:54,775 --> 00:08:00,342
or in other words, we have the geometric series as a convergent series in our comparison test

89
00:08:01,014 --> 00:08:05,544
and this immediately gives us that the series is absolutely convergent.

90
00:08:05,843 --> 00:08:12,480
Therefore one could say the root test is exactly the same as the comparison test with the geometric series.

91
00:08:12,943 --> 00:08:18,494
Still, this formulation might be easier for you, because you have something you can calculate.

92
00:08:18,814 --> 00:08:21,739
Let's simply demonstrate that with an example.

93
00:08:22,143 --> 00:08:27,120
So here we have a maybe complicated looking series, but there is a power involved.

94
00:08:27,686 --> 00:08:32,929
Hence the root test could be suitable to answer the question: if this series is convergent.

95
00:08:33,371 --> 00:08:36,709
So for the coefficient we take the kth root.

96
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:40,908
Then the power cancels out and only the power 2 remains.

97
00:08:41,386 --> 00:08:47,860
Hence we only have the fraction 9 over (2+k), which is less or equal than 9 over 10.

98
00:08:48,114 --> 00:08:51,918
Of course this only holds for k that are greater or equal than 8.

99
00:08:52,557 --> 00:08:57,988
In summary there we have our n_0 and there we have our q that is less than 1.

100
00:08:58,188 --> 00:09:03,790
Therefore we can conclude, this series is indeed convergent. Namely by our root test.

101
00:09:04,229 --> 00:09:08,981
Ok, so this was an example how you can apply this nice criterion.

102
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:15,732
However we can make it even better by avoiding that we have to choose q and n_0 in the end.

103
00:09:15,932 --> 00:09:21,962
Indeed this works, because we can reformulate the whole statement with the limit superior.

104
00:09:22,162 --> 00:09:28,700
In fact this is what you should remember. You can calculate the limit superior of the kth root of a_k

105
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:34,765
and if the result is strictly less than 1, our root test is fulfilled.

106
00:09:34,965 --> 00:09:41,816
In other words all the requirements are fulfilled and we can conclude that the series is absolutely convergent.

107
00:09:42,571 --> 00:09:47,769
In our example from before we just have to look at the limit superior of this result here.

108
00:09:47,969 --> 00:09:50,747
Which is in this case simply 0.

109
00:09:50,947 --> 00:09:57,666
Hence I think this is very helpful, psychologically helpful, because you don't have to guess a suitable q.

110
00:09:57,866 --> 00:10:01,554
You simply get a number out and you can check if this is less than 1.

111
00:10:02,186 --> 00:10:05,856
Also what one can prove is that it works the other way around.

112
00:10:06,414 --> 00:10:13,997
Meaning if the lim sup we calculate is strictly greater than 1, then the corresponding series is divergent.

113
00:10:14,386 --> 00:10:20,653
This also follows from the comparison test with the geometric series, but now with the minorant criterion.

114
00:10:21,143 --> 00:10:24,786
Ok, so please remember the whole thing here for the root test

115
00:10:24,986 --> 00:10:33,555
and please also remember if it happens that you get out 1 for the lim sup, we are not able to say what happens for the series.

116
00:10:34,114 --> 00:10:36,762
Indeed 3 cases are possible then.

117
00:10:37,171 --> 00:10:40,267
The first case would be: the series is divergent

118
00:10:40,467 --> 00:10:43,515
and the second case would be: it is absolutely convergent

119
00:10:43,715 --> 00:10:48,559
and the third case would be: it's neither of them. It's just convergent.

120
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:51,273
Ok, I thing that's good enough for today.

121
00:10:51,473 --> 00:10:57,757
In the next video we will still talk about series and I hope I see you there. Have a nice day. Bye!

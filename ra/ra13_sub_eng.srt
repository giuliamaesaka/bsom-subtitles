Hello and welcome back to real analysis.

2
00:00:04,043 --> 00:00:08,876
Of course as always I want to thank all the nice people that support this channel on Steady or Paypal.

3
00:00:09,429 --> 00:00:14,613
In today's part 13 we will talk about open, closed and compact sets.

4
00:00:14,813 --> 00:00:20,925
First please recall that for any point x on the number line, we have the epsilon-neighbourhoods.

5
00:00:21,214 --> 00:00:24,914
They are defined for positive epsilons as intervals.

6
00:00:25,686 --> 00:00:30,519
Namely we start at (x - epsilon) and go to (x + epsilon)

7
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:34,348
and then they are simply called the epsilon-neighbourhood of x

8
00:00:34,986 --> 00:00:39,746
and a common notation one uses is B with index epsilon of x.

9
00:00:39,946 --> 00:00:47,329
The important thing you should remember here is that all the points that are close to x, are inside this B_epsilon(x)

10
00:00:48,086 --> 00:00:52,170
and this closeness is just quantified with this value epsilon.

11
00:00:52,586 --> 00:00:56,357
Which gives us the maximum distance the points can have from x.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,855
However if you don't want or need to quantify the closeness, there is another notion one uses.

13
00:01:03,414 --> 00:01:06,609
Namely we simply call it a neighbourhood of x

14
00:01:07,214 --> 00:01:13,848
and this could be any subset of the real numbers, as long as we find the B_epsilon(x) inside

15
00:01:14,048 --> 00:01:23,736
or in other words: we need to find a positive number epsilon, such that the epsilon-neighbourhood of x, B_epsilon(x), is a subset of M.

16
00:01:23,936 --> 00:01:32,616
So you see the notion of neighbourhood of x is very general, but the crucial thing is that we find a normal epsilon-neighbourhood of x inside of it.

17
00:01:32,943 --> 00:01:35,986
Ok, maybe we should start with a simple example.

18
00:01:36,757 --> 00:01:41,008
If you have the number line in mind, we immediately get a lot of subsets.

19
00:01:41,208 --> 00:01:46,242
For example the interval that starts with the number -2 and goes to the number 2.

20
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,222
This set is the neighbourhood of the point x = 0.

21
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:56,309
However, also it's a neighbourhood of the point x = 1.

22
00:01:56,509 --> 00:02:02,389
The only important thing here is that we find an epsilon, that does not matter how large it is.

23
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:05,200
It only needs to be positive.

24
00:02:05,686 --> 00:02:10,765
So maybe here in the second case we have to choose a smaller epsilon, than before.

25
00:02:10,965 --> 00:02:14,948
However still, the only thing we need is that we find such an epsilon

26
00:02:15,771 --> 00:02:20,937
and we do not find such a number, if the point x is given by 2.

27
00:02:21,137 --> 00:02:28,096
Of course 2 is an element of this set, but an epsilon-neighbourhood around it lies not in the set.

28
00:02:28,296 --> 00:02:34,811
No matter how small the epsilon is, we always find a part of the epsilon-neighbourhood that lies outside.

29
00:02:35,011 --> 00:02:43,170
In summary, here we have an example of a set that is a neighbourhood of some elements of it, but for others it's not

30
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:49,140
and now a nice set, that is for all its members a neighbourhood, we call an open set.

31
00:02:49,814 --> 00:02:53,101
So these nice sets will get a special name.

32
00:02:53,301 --> 00:02:58,376
Later we will see, it's much better to work with open sets, than just with sets.

33
00:02:58,986 --> 00:03:05,392
Ok, now any subset of the real numbers is called open or more precisely open in R,

34
00:03:05,592 --> 00:03:10,203
if for each point x in M, M is a neighbourhood of this point.

35
00:03:11,114 --> 00:03:15,982
Hence such boundary points like this one, are not in the set M itself.

36
00:03:16,182 --> 00:03:21,958
Equivalently for the definition you could avoid the notion neighbourhood and just use the epsilon-neighbourhoods.

37
00:03:22,386 --> 00:03:30,423
So this means for all x in M, there exists an epsilon greater than 0, such that B_epsilon(x) is a subset of M.

38
00:03:30,623 --> 00:03:33,870
Of course we can also visualize that on the number line.

39
00:03:34,429 --> 00:03:38,466
So for example here, these 4 parts could be our set M

40
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:47,670
and then you can just pick any x from this set and then in the case that M is open, you find a small interval around this point

41
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:50,073
that is completely inside the set M.

42
00:03:50,273 --> 00:03:56,385
Hence in this picture, these boundary points here can't be a part of the set M.

43
00:03:56,585 --> 00:03:59,258
Otherwise it would not be an open set.

44
00:03:59,771 --> 00:04:06,453
Now on the other hand a set that contains all these possible boundary points gets also a special name.

45
00:04:07,086 --> 00:04:12,121
Such a set A we call closed or more concretely closed in R.

46
00:04:12,657 --> 00:04:17,808
The definition just reads that the complement of A, A^c is an open set.

47
00:04:18,229 --> 00:04:24,951
For example the interval from before as a closed set, because the complement outside is an open set.

48
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:31,022
Now one important thing you should really note here is that open is not the opposite of closed.

49
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,683
For example a set could be neither open nor closed

50
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:39,191
or the other way around, it could be open and closed at the same time.

51
00:04:40,043 --> 00:04:42,954
Ok, maybe that's a good time to look at some examples.

52
00:04:43,871 --> 00:04:46,946
Let's start with the simplest subsets you can imagine.

53
00:04:47,714 --> 00:04:50,608
Namely the empty set and R itself.

54
00:04:50,808 --> 00:04:57,077
Of course they are both open, because the condition we have here for openness is immediately fulfilled.

55
00:04:57,277 --> 00:05:03,049
For example for the empty set we don't have any problem, because there are no elements in the set at all

56
00:05:03,249 --> 00:05:10,401
and on the other hand for the real numbers we don't have any problem, because all intervals are subsets of the real number line.

57
00:05:10,957 --> 00:05:14,502
However now we also know, they are both closed.

58
00:05:14,929 --> 00:05:20,308
Simply, because the empty set is the complement of the real numbers and vice versa.

59
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,125
Ok, the next example we have already discussed. An interval of this form is closed, but not open.

60
00:05:27,543 --> 00:05:30,800
Therefore we often call such intervals, closed intervals.

61
00:05:31,614 --> 00:05:35,108
Of course then the next example would be an open interval.

62
00:05:35,814 --> 00:05:40,270
So that's good to know. When we use parentheses here we get an open set.

63
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:44,551
However in this case it's not a closed set, which you can prove.

64
00:05:45,043 --> 00:05:48,855
Ok and in the last example here I want to mix the brackets

65
00:05:49,055 --> 00:05:52,338
and in this case we don't have any of the 2 properties.

66
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,014
It's neither open nor closed.

67
00:05:55,729 --> 00:05:59,868
Ok, so you see these 2 definitions here are not so complicated at all.

68
00:06:00,271 --> 00:06:06,569
But please keep in mind, a subset of the real numbers could be much more complicated than just an interval.

69
00:06:07,271 --> 00:06:10,904
In order to deal with such sets the next fact is very helpful.

70
00:06:11,243 --> 00:06:15,868
It gives us a criterion to check closeness with the help of sequences.

71
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:29,477
Namely a set A is closed if and only if for all convergent sequences a_n with the property that all the sequence members lie inside the set A,

72
00:06:29,914 --> 00:06:33,842
we have that the limit lies also in A.

73
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:40,617
To put this in other words it's not possible to leave the set with sequences from the inside.

74
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:44,018
Also here it might be helpful to look at an example.

75
00:06:44,386 --> 00:06:49,977
Here on the the number line let's take the interval that starts with 0 and ends with 2.

76
00:06:50,986 --> 00:06:54,973
Here the number 2 lies inside the interval, but 0 does not.

77
00:06:55,173 --> 00:06:59,859
Hence we are not able to leave the interval from the inside to the right.

78
00:07:00,059 --> 00:07:05,530
For example we could take such a sequence, which is convergent, but then it would have the limit 2.

79
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:08,393
It's not possible to get the limit outside.

80
00:07:08,593 --> 00:07:11,980
However on the left-hand side it's indeed possible.

81
00:07:12,571 --> 00:07:15,870
For example we could take the sequence 1 over n.

82
00:07:16,586 --> 00:07:20,837
It's a convergent sequence, where all the sequence members lie inside A.

83
00:07:21,614 --> 00:07:26,528
However, the limit here is 0. Which is not an element of A.

84
00:07:26,728 --> 00:07:30,383
Hence the conclusion is: this set is not closed.

85
00:07:31,157 --> 00:07:35,288
Ok, now you should know the definition of open sets and closed sets.

86
00:07:35,986 --> 00:07:39,985
Therefore you are ready for the next definition about compact sets.

87
00:07:40,671 --> 00:07:47,277
It's a little bit more complicated, but because you already know sequences, we can use them to describe the definition.

88
00:07:47,477 --> 00:07:51,571
So we call a subset of the real numbers A, compact.

89
00:07:52,243 --> 00:07:57,872
If for all sequences a_n, again all the members should lie inside a set A,

90
00:07:58,629 --> 00:08:02,896
we find a convergent subsequence, where the limit lies in A.

91
00:08:03,096 --> 00:08:07,718
So you should see, this is different to the property of closeness from before.

92
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:13,015
Indeed here you could say a compact set enforces clustering inside it.

93
00:08:13,514 --> 00:08:20,300
Each sequence inside the set needs to have a cluster point, an accumulation value inside the set.

94
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:29,478
Now, if you compare this definition to the property of a closed set from before, with the sequences you see, this here requires much more.

95
00:08:30,314 --> 00:08:34,886
Hence you can already keep in mind, a compact set is necessarily closed.

96
00:08:35,386 --> 00:08:37,581
However not the other way around.

97
00:08:38,029 --> 00:08:44,191
Maybe you can immediately find a set that is closed by our definition, but not compact with this definition.

98
00:08:44,514 --> 00:08:50,778
Ok, then in the next video I will show you how we can describe these compact sets in simpler terms.

99
00:08:50,978 --> 00:08:53,518
This is called the Heine-Borel theorem.

100
00:08:53,986 --> 00:08:57,729
Therefore I hope I see you there and have a nice day. Bye!

00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,410
Hello and welcome back to real analysis

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:09,500
and as always many, many thanks to all the nice people that support this channel on Steady or Paypal.

3
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:14,590
In todays part 3 i will tell you more things about convergence sequences.

4
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,000
For this i think a good starting point would be to consider an example.

5
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,040
Here i have the sequence (an)

6
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,250
which is given by -1 to the power n.

7
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,740
So, this is an example we had in the last video,

8
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:32,800
but now we will show, that this sequence is not convergent.

9
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:36,960
Or in other words: We prove that the sequence is divergent.

10
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:39,790
Now the prove will work by contradiction.

11
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:43,180
Which means we will assume that the sequence has a limit "a".

12
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:46,490
So this could be any number on the number line,

13
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:48,800
where the sequence gets closer and closer to.

14
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,440
However, if you look at the number line

15
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:53,950
you already see that this can't happen.

16
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:57,430
Because the sequence jumps between -1 and 1.

17
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:01,020
Therefore it does not matter were we set the "a"

18
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:05,750
You always find infinitely many points that are far away from "a"

19
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:10,000
and of course this should not happen for a convergent sequence.

20
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:14,780
Hence for us it now remains to put this idea into a formal way.

21
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,750
So a good idea at the beginning would be

22
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:20,860
to write down the explicit definition of convergence.

23
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:24,410
Which reads that for every small number epsilon

24
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:26,430
we find an index "N"

25
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:29,250
such that for all indices afterwards

26
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:34,050
we have that the distance "an" to "a" is less than a given epsilon.

27
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:40,640
Now what we can put in is that the distance between -1 and 1 is exactly 2.

28
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:45,380
Ok, now the idea is that we have to choose epsilon so small

29
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:47,860
that in the epsilon-neighbourhood around "a"

30
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:50,870
we don't have -1 and 1 at the same time.

31
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:54,470
This means we need a number smaller or equal than 1

32
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:56,210
so lets choose 1.

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,900
Now by definiton for this epsilon we find a "N".

34
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:07,310
Therefore we now know, the distance from "an" to "a" is less than our given epsilon.

35
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:12,100
and of course we have also this result for the next member in the sequence.

36
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:16,260
Now you know this holds for infinitely many sequence members,

37
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:17,800
but we only need these two.

38
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:22,740
Because we know one of the two indices is even and the other is odd.

39
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,130
Therefore we get both outcomes

40
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:26,829
-1 and 1.

41
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:30,000
With this you might already see the problem we have

42
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:33,530
we measure two distances, but both are less than 1,

43
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:36,820
but the distance between -1 and 1 is still 2.

44
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,630
Therefore this should contradict the triangle inequality.

45
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:42,800
Ok, then lets write that down.

46
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45,630
First we note, when we add both distances here

47
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:47,760
we get a number that is less than 2

48
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,110
and on the other hand we already know

49
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:52,910
the distance between -1 and 1 is exactly 2.

50
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:57,900
Ok and now the idea is to go the detour with "a" in the middle.

51
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:02,050
In other words i want to get "a" into the absolute value here.

52
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:07,800
So lets write "- a + a" here and use the triangle inequality

53
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:09,560
and there you should see

54
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:13,160
this is exactly the same we have written at the right hand side before.

55
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:18,900
Which immediately leads to our contradiction, because we have 2 is less than 2.

56
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:23,720
So this is not correct, therefore the assumption has to be false.

57
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,600
Or in other words. This sequence is indeed divergent.

58
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:33,900
Ok, so here we have seen a sequence which does not have the nice property of convergence,

59
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,990
but still it has some properties.

60
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:40,860
and one important one is that this sequence is a bounded sequence.

61
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:44,600
Therefore now lets define what a bounded sequence is.

62
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,910
For this let "an" be any sequence of real numbers

63
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,940
and then we call it bounded

64
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:54,450
If there exists a real number "C"

65
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:57,990
such that for all sequence members we have

66
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:03,000
that the distance "an" to 0 is less or equal than "C"

67
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,760
You can visualize this on a number line

68
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:08,970
by putting in two bounds: "- C" and "C"

69
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:13,330
and then the whole sequence "an" just lives inside.

70
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:16,420
and of course if we don't find such a "C"

71
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,820
we just call the sequence unbounded.

72
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:22,480
An example of a bounded sequence you have already seen

73
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,240
in the example from the beginning.

74
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,440
There we can just set the "C" to be 1.

75
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,120
and then you see, the picture fits in.

76
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:33,590
However, we have even seen more examples,

77
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:35,940
because we have the following important fact.

78
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:41,600
If we have a convergent sequence we can conclude it's also bounded.

79
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:44,040
However, not the other way around

80
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,440
as we have seen in the first example today.

81
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:50,650
Another important fact you should remember here is the contraposition.

82
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:54,000
Which means if we have an unbounded sequence

83
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:56,560
we already know it can't be convergent

84
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:59,290
So lets prove this important fact here.

85
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:01,000
Which is indeed not so hard.

86
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,100
For this just recall again the definition of convergence.

87
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:08,480
So you know there exists a limit we call "a"

88
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:12,180
such that we have something we can visualize with this picture here.

89
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:17,280
We have that almost all points lie in the epsilon-neighbourhood around "a"

90
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,290
Therefore to get something like in the picture above

91
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:25,120
we simply have to define "C" or "- C" to be "a + epsilon"

92
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:29,000
or to be the member that is the farthest away from this epsilon-neighbourhood.

93
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,860
To put it into a formular

94
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:35,580
we just define "C" to be the maximum out of these finitely many numbers.

95
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:38,360
And if we take the absolute values

96
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:40,370
we don't have a problem with the sign.

97
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:43,070
We just get out "C" as a positive number.

98
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:46,640
and if we write "|a| + epsilon"

99
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:50,510
we get out a bound here, that is the farthest away from 0.

100
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:52,970
It could be this one or this one.

101
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:55,659
Depending where 0 lies here on the number line.

102
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:58,720
An important thing to note here is that "C"

103
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:00,660
obviously has to be positive,

104
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:03,670
but we don't have to find the minimal possible "C"

105
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,400
We just have to find a "C".

106
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,320
and that's what we get with this definition here.

107
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:12,970
Knowing this lets get to another important fact about sequences.

108
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:17,740
You know if you consider a convergent sequence, you find such a limit "a",

109
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:20,460
but this "a" is indeed uniquely given.

110
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:25,150
Therefore we are able to speak of THE limit of the convergent sequence.

111
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:29,430
Moreover the notation "limit an" makes sense.

112
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:33,350
So lets end this video by proving this important fact.

113
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:38,280
Lets assume that we have two different limits "a" and "ã"

114
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:43,210
This means the distance between both of them is greater than 0.

115
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:46,110
Now, if you visualize this on the number line

116
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:48,520
 you already see, this can't happen

117
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:51,990
because you know, for an arbitrary epsilon

118
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,300
the sequence members lie inside the epsilon-neighbourhood eventually.

119
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:59,820
and this works for "a" and " ã " as well.

120
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:04,000
Which is clearly a contradiction when epsilon is small enough.

121
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,910
Ignoring finitely many sequence members

122
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:10,520
you can't have all sequence members inside this epsilon-neighbourhood

123
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:11,560
and in this one.

124
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:15,570
This clearly contradicts the definition of convergence.

125
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:18,210
In this sense this picture says it all.

126
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:20,770
Now we just have to put this into formulars.

127
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,630
Or in other words 

128
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:26,100
choose a small enough epsilon such that this picture works.

129
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:30,240
You see it has to be less than the distance between "a" and " ã "

130
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,750
so lets choose a quarter of this distance.

131
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:36,100
Therefore this is our epsilon now.

132
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:39,409
Now by the definition of the convergence 

133
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:42,700
we know for this epsilon we find a "N".

134
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:47,830
and then we have that all sequence members after "N" fulfill this.

135
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:52,350
However, of course by assumption we have the same for "ã"

136
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:57,540
and the "N" we find for "ã" we can just call "Ñ"

137
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:01,410
Therefore now we can just choose a "n" 

138
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:04,220
which is greater than "N" and "Ñ"

139
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:08,210
Hence we simply set it as greater or equal than the maximum.

140
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:12,440
and then of course we want to use the triangle inequality again.

141
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:17,280
This means between "a" and " ã " we put in our "an"

142
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:20,680
and then we just split that into our two parts.

143
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:25,150
and at this point we know by the assumption of the two limits 

144
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,700
that this one is less than epsilon

145
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,760
and this one

146
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:33,549
Now using the definition of epsilon we now get

147
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:37,409
that the left hand side is less than the right hand side.

148
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:39,730
which is one half of the left hand side.

149
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:42,620
However, we have positive numbers here. 

150
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,130
So this can't happen.

151
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,640
and with this we have the whole proof.

152
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:49,620
Which was indeed just the picture i showed you before.

153
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,180
Of course this fact here is what we will use for the whole course.

154
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:58,800
Therefore please remember a convergent sequence has a unique limit.

155
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:01,760
With this i hope to see you in the next video.

156
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:03,850
Have a nice day and Bye!

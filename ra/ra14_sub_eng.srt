00:00:00,471 --> 00:00:03,437
Hello and welcome back to real analysis

2
00:00:03,971 --> 00:00:09,277
and as always many, many to all the nice people that support this channel on Steady or Paypal.

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:14,056
In today's part 14 we will talk about the Heine-Borel theorem.

4
00:00:14,256 --> 00:00:18,876
In order to understand this, we first have to recall what a compact set is.

5
00:00:19,429 --> 00:00:25,838
Here I can tell you, the definition we use for a compact set other people call sequentially compact.

6
00:00:26,414 --> 00:00:29,834
It just means that we use sequences to describe compactness.

7
00:00:30,586 --> 00:00:35,986
Now please recall that any subset A of the real numbers is called a compact set,

8
00:00:35,987 --> 00:00:38,786
if it forces any sequence to cluster.

9
00:00:39,171 --> 00:00:43,429
So a sequence with members in A has at least one accumulation value.

10
00:00:44,257 --> 00:00:50,359
However, the important thing is that this accumulation value also has to lie inside the set A.

11
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,143
Also please note here,

12
00:00:52,186 --> 00:00:59,214
this is a short formulation for saying that we have a sequence of real numbers, where each member is an element of the set A.

13
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:04,157
Ok, so we know the definition, therefore we now can look at examples

14
00:01:04,929 --> 00:01:07,228
and I would say we start with the simplest one.

15
00:01:07,957 --> 00:01:13,368
The empty set does not have any elements. Therefore this claim here is trivially true.

16
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:16,047
Hence the set is compact.

17
00:01:16,247 --> 00:01:21,106
Similarly we can take another small set, so a set with just one element.

18
00:01:21,306 --> 00:01:25,743
This one is also compact, because there is only one possible sequence.

19
00:01:26,543 --> 00:01:31,015
In this case we have the constant sequence 5 with accumulation value 5.

20
00:01:31,215 --> 00:01:33,267
Ok, so this was not so hard.

21
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:37,606
Therefore now my question would be: "What is about the largest subset we can choose?"

22
00:01:38,157 --> 00:01:41,545
there we have to look at all sequences of real numbers.

23
00:01:41,745 --> 00:01:45,863
For example I can give you the sequence that increases with n.

24
00:01:46,063 --> 00:01:52,734
So this sequence is divergent to infinity. Therefore there is no accumulation value as an element of R.

25
00:01:52,934 --> 00:01:56,197
Hence we immediately have a set that is not compact.

26
00:01:56,914 --> 00:01:59,236
Next let's look at a closed interval.

27
00:02:00,114 --> 00:02:04,865
Such an interval with real numbers c and d is indeed a compact set.

28
00:02:05,065 --> 00:02:07,517
Ok, so let's try to proof this.

29
00:02:08,114 --> 00:02:12,536
For this let's assume we have a sequence with members inside this interval.

30
00:02:12,736 --> 00:02:18,419
Hence we can immediately conclude that this sequence is bounded from above and bounded from below.

31
00:02:18,957 --> 00:02:21,657
In short we say this sequence is bounded.

32
00:02:22,014 --> 00:02:26,271
However now you know, we can apply a very famous theorem.

33
00:02:26,471 --> 00:02:30,419
Namely the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem for sequences.

34
00:02:30,871 --> 00:02:35,403
It tells us that a bounded sequence has at least one accumulation value

35
00:02:36,071 --> 00:02:39,787
and this one we can call "a" and we know, it's a real number.

36
00:02:40,143 --> 00:02:45,808
Now the only information that is still missing is that "a" is actually an element of our set.

37
00:02:46,629 --> 00:02:52,481
However this is guaranteed, because we already know that such an interval is a closed set.

38
00:02:52,957 --> 00:02:58,892
Here please recall, closed means that we can't leave the set by using sequences from the inside

39
00:02:59,092 --> 00:03:03,036
and with this we have proven that the set is indeed compact.

40
00:03:03,543 --> 00:03:08,401
Hence all intervals of this form we know can just call compact intervals.

41
00:03:08,971 --> 00:03:12,105
Ok, now we are ready for the Heine-Borel theorem.

42
00:03:13,071 --> 00:03:19,263
It tells us that the two properties we used in this proof here, are actually exactly what we need for a compact set.

43
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:23,100
Hence it's a theorem that is not hard to remember at all.

44
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:32,893
So for any subset A of the real numbers, we have that it is compact if and only if A is bounded and closed.

45
00:03:33,457 --> 00:03:36,562
It's essential that we have both things here together.

46
00:03:36,871 --> 00:03:43,990
This theorem is a very good result for us, because it tells us that we can substitute the complicated notion of compactness

47
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:47,141
with the simpler notions of boundedness and closeness.

48
00:03:47,843 --> 00:03:53,911
Ok, so this is the Heine-Borel theorem, which holds for the real numbers and you really should remember it.

49
00:03:54,111 --> 00:03:57,930
For the rest of the video, I would say let's to the proof of it.

50
00:03:58,357 --> 00:04:03,283
Indeed the direction from the right-hand side to the left-hand side, we have already proven.

51
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:11,785
Of course you remember the only things we needed for the argument above is that A is a bounded set, such that we can use Bolzano-Weierstrass

52
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:14,143
ans the other thing was that the set is closed.

53
00:04:14,886 --> 00:04:19,107
Which guarantees us that the accumulation value is actually in A.

54
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:23,352
Therefore only the direction from left to right remains.

55
00:04:23,552 --> 00:04:26,835
Hence assume that our set A is compact.

56
00:04:27,214 --> 00:04:32,539
Now for showing the closeness we take any convergent sequence in the set A

57
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:35,627
and let's call the limit for the moment "a" tilde.

58
00:04:36,429 --> 00:04:39,777
First we only know that the limit is a real number.

59
00:04:40,214 --> 00:04:45,688
If we can show that it is also an element in A, we have shown that a set is closed.

60
00:04:45,888 --> 00:04:49,303
Ok, so at this point we can use that A is compact,

61
00:04:49,657 --> 00:04:53,763
because it tells us that the sequence a_n has an accumulation value

62
00:04:54,186 --> 00:04:57,934
and as before let's call this accumulation value just "a"

63
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:03,319
and now we already know, a convergent sequence can only have one accumulation value.

64
00:05:03,843 --> 00:05:07,786
Hence our limit "a" tilde is the same as "a"

65
00:05:07,986 --> 00:05:11,385
and therefore also an element in our set A.

66
00:05:11,871 --> 00:05:14,033
So the set A is closed.

67
00:05:14,643 --> 00:05:18,456
Ok, so it remains to show that A is bounded as well

68
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:22,296
and in order to show this we use a proof by contra position.

69
00:05:22,496 --> 00:05:29,024
More concretely this means that we assume that A is not bounded and want to show that A is not compact.

70
00:05:29,514 --> 00:05:34,103
Now, whenever we have unbounded sets, we can construct the sequence in the set,

71
00:05:34,303 --> 00:05:40,080
such that all sequence member fulfill that the absolute value of a_n is greater than n

72
00:05:40,443 --> 00:05:43,361
and this should work for all natural numbers n

73
00:05:43,886 --> 00:05:49,345
and because of this property such a sequence can't have any accumulation value.

74
00:05:49,545 --> 00:05:52,698
This is not hard to show, but maybe it's a good exercise for you.

75
00:05:53,657 --> 00:06:00,707
Of course the important thing is the result. We have a sequence that has no accumulation value, therefore the set can't be compact.

76
00:06:01,586 --> 00:06:04,876
and that is the proof of the Heine-Borel theorem.

77
00:06:05,157 --> 00:06:10,471
So you see, it's not so complicated, but still the important part is that you remember the theorem.

78
00:06:11,529 --> 00:06:16,473
Ok, then I hope I see you in the next video, when we continue with another topic in real analysis.

79
00:06:17,157 --> 00:06:18,957
Have a nice day! Bye!

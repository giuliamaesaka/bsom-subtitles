Hello and welcome back to real analysis

2
00:00:03,971 --> 00:00:08,800
and as always many many thanks to all the nice people that support me on Steady or Paypal.

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:13,957
Today in part 9 we will talk about subsequences and accumulation values.

4
00:00:14,486 --> 00:00:19,214
For this let's immediately start with a picture of a sequence on the real number line.

5
00:00:19,786 --> 00:00:24,279
There we have a lot of points called a_1, a_2, a_3 and so on.

6
00:00:24,786 --> 00:00:30,748
Now, the term subsequence is not so hard to understand. We just omit some members of this sequence.

7
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:39,651
For example we can take the 1st one, but then omit the 2nd one, but then again take the 3rd one and 4th one and then omit some other ones.

8
00:00:40,214 --> 00:00:44,265
The only thing we need is that we still have infinitely many members.

9
00:00:44,971 --> 00:00:47,457
So we still have a sequence in the end.

10
00:00:47,971 --> 00:00:51,137
However then we need a new name for the sequence members,

11
00:00:51,337 --> 00:00:55,964
because a sequence is a map from the natural numbers into the real numbers.

12
00:00:56,343 --> 00:01:02,288
Therefore the first member needs the index 1 and the second member the index 2.

13
00:01:03,086 --> 00:01:07,652
Therefore usually we use n as an index with an additional index.

14
00:01:08,229 --> 00:01:13,643
Hence here you should see, n with index k is a sequence of natural numbers.

15
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:17,758
Moreover it needs to be strictly monotonically increasing.

16
00:01:18,586 --> 00:01:23,586
This simply means that for all sequence members the successor gets strictly greater.

17
00:01:24,471 --> 00:01:31,184
Then in this case the sequence with index k here, is called a subsequence of the original sequence a_n.

18
00:01:31,757 --> 00:01:39,773
So this is our first definition for today. We are allowed to omit some members, but then we need a new enumeration given by k.

19
00:01:39,973 --> 00:01:43,490
Ok, maybe it gets clear when we look at an example.

20
00:01:43,971 --> 00:01:46,657
For this lets take a sequence we already know.

21
00:01:47,057 --> 00:01:50,851
Namely a_n is given by 1/n.

22
00:01:51,671 --> 00:01:57,699
Now the question is: what is the subsequence, when we choose n_k as 2 to the power k?

23
00:01:57,986 --> 00:02:01,171
Please note this is a possible choice for the sequence n_k,

24
00:02:01,257 --> 00:02:07,100
because 2 to the power k is a sequence of natural numbers, that is strictly monotonically increasing.

25
00:02:08,014 --> 00:02:15,071
Now, this means in the original sequence here, we will omit all the members that have an index that is not a power of 2.

26
00:02:15,929 --> 00:02:22,501
Therefore the first one should be 1/2, the next one 1/4, then we go to 1/8 and so on.

27
00:02:23,071 --> 00:02:26,782
Hence our subsequence a_n_k looks like this.

28
00:02:27,457 --> 00:02:33,313
One important thing you should note here, is that we can't change the overall order the sequence had before.

29
00:02:33,814 --> 00:02:40,658
This means that in the case that the sequence visits 1/2 only once and also 1/4 only once

30
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:51,364
and when know in addition that 1/4 comes after 1/2, then it's not possible that in the subsequence we have 1/4 before 1/2.

31
00:02:52,129 --> 00:03:00,240
In particular if we have such a monotonic sequence, we already know that the subsequence is also monotonic in the same way.

32
00:03:00,771 --> 00:03:06,761
Another thing you should note here is that we can omit a lot of sequence members, even infinitely many.

33
00:03:06,961 --> 00:03:10,123
As long as infinitely many remain.

34
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:15,995
Ok, one thing we didn't discuss yet, is what happens with the limit if we go to a subsequence.

35
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:22,637
In our example here you see, the limit is 0 for this sequence, but also for this sequence.

36
00:03:23,157 --> 00:03:25,984
Or in other words we don't change the limit here.

37
00:03:26,329 --> 00:03:29,783
Indeed this is a general fact that always holds.

38
00:03:29,983 --> 00:03:35,728
So if we have a sequence a_n, where we already know it's convergent with limit "a",

39
00:03:35,928 --> 00:03:40,132
then any subsequence we can choose is also convergent.

40
00:03:40,586 --> 00:03:48,063
Moreover we also know when we calculate the limit, which means we send k to infinity, we get the same result as before.

41
00:03:48,429 --> 00:03:53,986
Ok, maybe that's not so surprising, but at this point you could ask: "Why do we even need subsequences?"

42
00:03:54,686 --> 00:03:58,643
and the answer is, they help us to analyse divergent sequences.

43
00:03:59,414 --> 00:04:04,061
For this let's look at an example we already discussed at the beginning of this course.

44
00:04:04,614 --> 00:04:07,174
Namely (-1) to the power n.

45
00:04:07,571 --> 00:04:14,653
On the number line this means that we hit the point 1 infinitely many times and also the point -1.

46
00:04:15,486 --> 00:04:19,078
So clearly this is a sequence that is not convergent.

47
00:04:19,714 --> 00:04:23,241
However we still find convergent subsequences.

48
00:04:23,614 --> 00:04:30,805
For example we could restrict ourself to the even indices. Which means we stay at 1 for the whole sequence.

49
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,824
Clearly that's a convergent sequence

50
00:04:34,643 --> 00:04:37,374
and we immediately see the limit, which is 1.

51
00:04:38,014 --> 00:04:41,195
Of course we can also consider the odd indices.

52
00:04:41,395 --> 00:04:43,787
Which means we stay at -1 the whole time.

53
00:04:44,686 --> 00:04:49,313
This means that we get another subsequence, which is also clearly convergent.

54
00:04:50,029 --> 00:04:53,775
However with another limit, which is -1 in this case.

55
00:04:54,171 --> 00:05:01,107
Ok and now these limits we get for subsequences are called accumulation values for the sequence a_n.

56
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,468
Indeed that will be our next definition.

57
00:05:05,243 --> 00:05:12,230
So any real number "a" is called an accumulation value of the corresponding sequence a_n

58
00:05:12,871 --> 00:05:17,512
if there is a subsequence a_n_k that has "a" as its limit.

59
00:05:17,712 --> 00:05:24,570
Ok, recalling the fact from above, you see that accumulation value is a generalization of the term limit,

60
00:05:25,043 --> 00:05:28,957
because a convergent sequence can only have one accumulation value.

61
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:30,608
Namely the limit.

62
00:05:30,808 --> 00:05:35,236
However for a divergent sequence we could have different accumulation values.

63
00:05:35,436 --> 00:05:39,651
Of course this example here was very simple, so let's look at another picture.

64
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:44,450
So you could imagine a sequence that jumps to different parts on the number line,

65
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:49,516
but then it goes back and it gets closer and closer to 4 different points.

66
00:05:50,257 --> 00:05:57,836
You don't have a limit, because the sequence still jumps around, but you get closer and closer to different accumulation values

67
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:05,320
or in other words, you could restrict yourself to sequence members that only live here and then you get a convergent sequence

68
00:06:06,271 --> 00:06:08,743
and of course you can do the same for the other 3 parts.

69
00:06:09,414 --> 00:06:16,137
Therefore you could say an accumulation value is just a point on the number line, where the sequence accumulates.

70
00:06:16,614 --> 00:06:21,693
Another thing i should really tell you is that there are a lot of different names for the same thing.

71
00:06:21,893 --> 00:06:26,061
For example, not so surprising, some people call it a "cluster point"

72
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,713
or also "accumulation point" instead of "value".

73
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:34,046
However a little bit more confusing is the term "limit point".

74
00:06:34,471 --> 00:06:40,461
Of course it makes sense, but please be careful. You could have many limit points for one sequence a_n.

75
00:06:40,661 --> 00:06:45,194
Therefore to avoid this confusion some people use the term "partial limit".

76
00:06:45,671 --> 00:06:48,671
However I will stay at the term "accumulation value".

77
00:06:49,429 --> 00:06:54,637
Ok, for the end of this video I give you an alternative definition of accumulation value

78
00:06:54,837 --> 00:07:04,357
or to put it in other words, "a" is an accumulation value of the sequence a_n, if and only if for all epsilon greater than 0, 

79
00:07:04,471 --> 00:07:12,329
we have that the epsilon-neighbourhood of "a" contains infinitely many sequence members of our given sequence a_n.

80
00:07:12,929 --> 00:07:18,075
Of course this description fits perfectly with our name accumulation or cluster.

81
00:07:18,275 --> 00:07:23,868
Now, this statement is not so hard to show, you only have to recall that the epsilon-neighbourhood of "a" 

82
00:07:24,457 --> 00:07:29,846
is given by the interval (a-epsilon, a+epsilon).

83
00:07:30,329 --> 00:07:38,066
Ok, then in the next video we will talk more about accumulation values and also talk about the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem.

84
00:07:38,686 --> 00:07:43,193
This theorem will tell us something about the existence of accumulation values.

85
00:07:43,757 --> 00:07:46,735
Therefore I hope I see you there and have a nice day.

86
00:07:46,971 --> 00:07:47,843
Bye!

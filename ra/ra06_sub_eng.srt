Hello and welcome back to real analysis

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:08,880
and as always first i want to thank all the people that support this channel on Steady or Paypal.

3
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:13,170
In todays part 6 we will talk about the supremum and the infimum.

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:18,600
However before we start with this lets look at some simple subsets of the number line.

5
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:25,110
We can see the real numbers as this number line, because we know the real numbers are totally ordered.

6
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:33,220
Therefore it makes sense to say we start with a number "a" and then we go to another number "b" which is greater or equal than "a"

7
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:38,000
and now all the numbers in between i want to put in one set.

8
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:46,400
Such a set is then called an interval where we use different brackets to denote if the endpoints are included or excluded.

9
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:51,720
In this case here the set consists of all the points "x" that are inbetween "a" and "b".

10
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:55,900
However "a" itself is not in the set, but "b" is.

11
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:59,590
Of course you can change that just by changing the brackets.

12
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:01,430
So please remember that.

13
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:04,950
We use the round brackets, the parentheses to denote exclusion.

14
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:10,090
With this you see, intervals are just special subsets of the real number line.

15
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:13,200
Please note we also use the interval notation

16
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:15,220
when we don't have a bound on one side.

17
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:22,420
There we simple use the symbol infinity to denote that we start with "a", but then we go as far as we want.

18
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:27,090
So this interval consists of all the points  "x" that are greater or equal than "a".

19
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:31,410
And in the same way the symbol minus infinity is used.

20
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:38,720
Ok, now you should see these intervals are very nice subsets of the real numbers, but of course not the only ones.

21
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:44,840
For example we could consider a set M that consists of all the points here on the number line.

22
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:48,140
It's much more complicated than just an interval,

23
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:51,650
but still we can talk about nice properties of the subset M.

24
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:56,250
For example this point here that is the farest on the right hand side of M

25
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:58,100
We could call the maximum of M.

26
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:01,100
In short we would just write "max M".

27
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:04,630
We could also call it an upper bound for the set M,

28
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:08,650
because there is no other point in M that exceeds this number.

29
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:13,150
However, this property holds for all the numbers here on the right hand side

30
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:18,250
Hence every point in this region here is called an upper bound for M.

31
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,900
and then you might already guess, we have lower bounds here on the left.

32
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:28,420
Now, what we also see on the left is that we don't find a minimal element in M.

33
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:33,120
Simply because the boundary point here is not an element in M.

34
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:35,830
Hence if we just live in the set M

35
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,220
we can go to the left, but we never find a smallest one.

36
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:43,270
Ok, so lets put all of this into a definition.

37
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:49,220
So for any subset M we call a real number "b" an upper bound for M

38
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:53,340
if all elements in M are less or equal than this "b".

39
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:56,170
There are two important things you should really note here.

40
00:02:56,230 --> 00:03:00,610
First "b" is just a real number. It does not have to lie in M.

41
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:05,160
and second we could have a lot of different upper bounds for the set M.

42
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:09,130
Therefore we just talk about an upper bound for the set M.

43
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:14,060
Now in the same way a real number "a" is called a lower bound for M

44
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:18,590
if for all "x" in M. 
"x" is greater or equal than this "a".

45
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:22,850
Now in the case that for a set M such an upper bound exist

46
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,920
we call the set bounded from above.

47
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:29,280
and in the case a lower bound exist we call it bounded from below.

48
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,130
and you might already guess.

49
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,250
If we have both things we just call the set bounded

50
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:39,930
Ok, lets also fix the other notations we use namely maximum and minimum.

51
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:45,250
Indeed this is very simple. If we have an upper bound "b" for the set M

52
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:48,640
and this "b" is also an element of M.

53
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:51,940
Then "b" is called a maximal element of M.

54
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:57,180
and here we can show that we can only have at most one maximal element.

55
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:00,840
Hence the notation we use "max M" is justified.

56
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:04,070
Now the same definition we also have for a lower bound

57
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:09,180
which is also in the set M and then we call it a minimal element.

58
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:13,560
and the notation we use there is simply given by "min M"

59
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,440
Ok, to get an idea of this lets look at a concrete example.

60
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:23,020
Here the set M should be the interval that starts with 1 and ends with 3.

61
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:26,040
and both numbers are included in the set.

62
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:30,350
Therefore we immediately see the maximum of M is the number 3

63
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:32,780
and the minimum of M is the number 1.

64
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:37,050
However, when we now consider the set where we exclude both numbers

65
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:41,080
we see that maximum and minimum don't exist.

66
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:46,520
In this case these two end points can't be described by these simple descriptions.

67
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:52,120
There we really need a new idea and this leads us to supremum and infimum.

68
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,870
In order to define these two new things lets look at the number line again.

69
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:02,780
So here you see our interval 1, 3. Where 1 and 3 are not included.

70
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,530
Now we know for example 5 is an upper bound for this set.

71
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:13,170
However we can also choose a smaller one. For example 4 is also an upper bound.

72
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:18,890
Then the general idea is that we push this upper bound as far to the left as we can.

73
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:24,710
Therefore in this case we will find the number 3 as the lowest possible upper bound

74
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:28,620
and that is exactly what we will call the supremum of M

75
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:36,820
actually then the result will be that this works for any set M. So any subset of R and not just for intervals.

76
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:42,200
But for this we really need to write down the correct definition for the lowest upper bound.

77
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:46,430
So lets consider again any subset M of the real numbers

78
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:50,170
and then a real number "s" is called supremum of M

79
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:52,970
if it fulfils two properties.

80
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:57,420
The first one you already know. You want that "s" is an upper bound for M.

81
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,800
So this is exactly the definition we had above.

82
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:07,120
and now together with the second property we should describe that we get indeed the lowest upper bound.

83
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:13,450
and there the idea should be if we subtract a small number epsilon from this number "s"

84
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:17,450
we should get out a number that is not an upper bound anymore.

85
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:24,660
In other words on the right of this number "s - epsilon" we will find at least one element of M.

86
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:30,330
and if this works no matter how small we choose the epsilon we have the lowest upper bound described.

87
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,990
Now in formulars we would write there is some "x tilde"

88
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:37,440
such that "s-epsilon" is less than this x tilde

89
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:43,390
So please note this means exactly that "s-epsilon" is not an upper bound for M.

90
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:48,290
and of course this needs to work for any epsilon greater than 0.

91
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:54,200
Ok, in the case such an "s", the supremum of M exist we use the notation from above.

92
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:58,620
This makes sense, because you can easily show if the supremum exist

93
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:01,750
there can only be one number "s" with these properties.

94
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:06,630
However we want even more. Even in the case that a supremum does not exist

95
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:08,870
because there is no upper bound for the set M

96
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:10,870
We want to use this symbol here.

97
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:15,470
Then supremum of M should just stand for the symbol infinity

98
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:19,660
Then we quarantee that this notation always has a meaning.

99
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:26,120
Maybe the only other strange case would be when you want to calculate the supremum of the empty set.

100
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:32,950
Because there all numbers are upper bounds for this set we use the symbol minus infinity there.

101
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:38,100
Ok there you have it. This is the whole definition for the supremum of a set M.

102
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:42,310
and similarly we can write down the definition for the infimum.

103
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:45,290
Of course this looks almost the same

104
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:48,909
because the only difference ist now that we are on the left hand side here

105
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,640
and increase the lower bounds.

106
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,900
Therefore this "l" should be the greatest lower bound for M.

107
00:07:55,660 --> 00:08:01,240
So what you should see here is the only difference to the supremum is the directions of the inequalities.

108
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:08,510
Also we have the similar notation if the infimum exist and otherwise we use the symbols infinity as well.

109
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:14,450
So i already told you, if we write "sup M" or "inf M", it always has a meaning.

110
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:20,050
In fact this is a result that follows from the completeness axiom of the real numbers.

111
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:24,450
So it would not be true if you were working just with rational numbers.

112
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:27,740
So i would say, please remember the whole definition here

113
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:31,910
and then in the next video i'll explain connection to the completeness axiom.

114
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,900
and of course i also show you more examples.

115
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:38,750
Therefore i hope i see you there and have a nice day. Bye!

Hello and welcome back to real analysis

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:08,933
and as always first I want to thank all the nice people that support this channel on Steady or Paypal.

3
00:00:09,133 --> 00:00:13,214
In today's part 17 we still talk about series.

4
00:00:13,386 --> 00:00:19,643
More concretely we will use this video and the next ones to talk about criteria we have to check for convergence.

5
00:00:19,971 --> 00:00:24,573
For this please recall that a series is just a sequence of partial sums

6
00:00:25,129 --> 00:00:31,063
and in the case that this sequence is convergent we also use this symbol to denote the limit.

7
00:00:31,263 --> 00:00:36,247
Therefore by applying the well known limit theorems we can write down some properties.

8
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:40,485
Therefore we take 2 series that need to be convergent

9
00:00:40,843 --> 00:00:47,028
and then we can say something about the series that is given by the sequence a_k + b_k.

10
00:00:47,657 --> 00:00:51,338
So here keep in mind we have a new sequence of partial sums.

11
00:00:51,943 --> 00:00:57,293
Now the result, which is not so surprising, is that this series is also convergent.

12
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:04,881
We know even more. We can immediately calculate the limit. It's just given by the sum of the two limits.

13
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:11,064
Of course all of this is just an application of the limit theorems you already learned for sequences

14
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:19,230
However in this case, when we have convergent series, it tells us that we can pull the addition out of this symbol.

15
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:26,108
Of course for a normal sum this always works but please keep in mind this symbol here is not a normal sum.

16
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:32,171
Ok and another property we get from ordinary sums is given by the multiplication.

17
00:01:32,555 --> 00:01:38,474
Namely we have the distributive law when we multiply all the terms in the sum with the same factor.

18
00:01:38,674 --> 00:01:44,821
For a series this means, if the original series is convergent then also this one.

19
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:52,446
No matter which real number we choose for lambda. Also here this follows immediately from the limit theorems

20
00:01:52,646 --> 00:01:56,779
and we get the calculation rule that we can pull out lambda.

21
00:01:57,614 --> 00:02:04,002
Ok these two properties you really should remember and you should remember that they hold for convergent series.

22
00:02:04,202 --> 00:02:09,649
Therefore a natural question would be: how can we check that a given series is indeed convergent?

23
00:02:09,849 --> 00:02:14,970
In fact there are a lot of different criteria one can apply to answer this question.

24
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:20,333
The first one I want to show you just uses the completeness axiom of the real numbers.

25
00:02:20,533 --> 00:02:23,500
Therefore it's called the Cauchy criterion.

26
00:02:24,143 --> 00:02:30,899
Please recall in the real numbers being a convergent sequence is equivalent for being a Cauchy sequence

27
00:02:31,271 --> 00:02:37,044
and there the important part was that for a Cauchy sequence we don't have to know the limit.

28
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:42,532
Therefore this criterion will check for convergence but it does not tell you the limit.

29
00:02:43,257 --> 00:02:50,402
Of course often this is good enough. For example if you just want to justify that you are allowed to use these calculation rules here.

30
00:02:51,071 --> 00:02:57,258
Hence the criterion tells us that the series is convergent if and only if

31
00:02:57,458 --> 00:03:03,875
for all epsilon greater than 0 there exists a capital N,

32
00:03:04,075 --> 00:03:11,820
such that for all indices n and m greater than this capital N, where also n is greater or equal than m,

33
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:21,589
we have that the absolute value of the partial sum, starting with m and ending with n is less than epsilon.

34
00:03:22,314 --> 00:03:32,157
In other words, if you can show that this expression here is arbitrarily small eventually, then you know the series is convergent

35
00:03:32,286 --> 00:03:38,565
and on the other hand, if you can show that this expression stays large or larger than a given constant,

36
00:03:38,765 --> 00:03:41,724
then you know the series is not convergent.

37
00:03:42,114 --> 00:03:46,874
Ok, before I show you an example let's do the proof of the statement here.

38
00:03:47,074 --> 00:03:51,676
This is not so complicated, because we just have to use the completeness axiom.

39
00:03:52,043 --> 00:03:56,606
First let's define the partial sums as always denoted by s_n.

40
00:03:56,806 --> 00:04:03,757
Then we know the sequence s_n is convergent if and only if it is a Cauchy sequence.

41
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:08,481
That is exactly what we know as the completeness of the real numbers.

42
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:13,783
If you don't know anymore what a Cauchy sequence is, let's write down the definition.

43
00:04:14,486 --> 00:04:23,775
It just means that for all epsilon greater 0 there exists a capital N such that for all indices afterwards we can calculate the difference

44
00:04:23,975 --> 00:04:27,870
and then in the absolute value it should be less than epsilon.

45
00:04:28,471 --> 00:04:35,654
Here you see the indices are called n-tilde and m-tilde, just because I want to redefine them in the next step.

46
00:04:35,854 --> 00:04:39,322
You already know, what we want is an expression like this.

47
00:04:39,943 --> 00:04:47,768
Hence now you can see n should be always the larger index here and m-tilde I want to shift by 1.

48
00:04:47,968 --> 00:04:51,932
Hence here we get s_n - s_(m-1).

49
00:04:52,132 --> 00:04:56,856
First you should see this is indeed a special case of the property we had here

50
00:04:57,056 --> 00:05:04,779
and on the other hand you should see it's not a restriction at all, because the only case we really miss is when we have the same index here.

51
00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:11,880
But of course in the case that we have the same index there we always get 0 out, which is always less than epsilon.

52
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,577
Therefore this reformulation for a Cauchy sequence is always allowed.

53
00:05:16,777 --> 00:05:21,850
Ok, now we only have to see that this difference is exactly this sum here.

54
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:25,772
Hence this is the whole proof of the Cauchy criterion.

55
00:05:26,214 --> 00:05:29,244
Now, as promised let's apply it to an example.

56
00:05:29,814 --> 00:05:34,159
Ok, I would say let's look at the example we had at the beginning of this course.

57
00:05:34,529 --> 00:05:40,986
Of course we already know it's not convergent, but the question would be how can we show it with the Cauchy criterion.

58
00:05:41,414 --> 00:05:44,554
For this we have to calculate this partial sum here.

59
00:05:45,086 --> 00:05:52,232
Now you already know we only need to calculate this for indices n, m that are greater or equal than some capital N.

60
00:05:52,614 --> 00:05:56,603
Therefore maybe let's substitute the m with the capital N.

61
00:05:56,803 --> 00:06:01,612
In other words we look at the special case for m and we can do the same for n.

62
00:06:01,812 --> 00:06:11,971
For example it would be allowed to choose N+2. Therefore the sum consists of exactly three numbers and of course we can calculate them

63
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:19,056
We just have to distinguish two different cases. The first case would be N is even.

64
00:06:19,256 --> 00:06:31,910
Then we have 1+(-1)+1. Therefore for an even N we get out 1 for the sum. Of course then the absolute value does not change anything

65
00:06:32,571 --> 00:06:41,135
Ok, then the other case would be then an odd N, which means we start with -1, then comes 1 and then we add -1 again.

66
00:06:41,814 --> 00:06:52,768
Hence the result is -1, but with the absolute value it's 1 as well. Hence no matter what N is this expression is always exactly 1.

67
00:06:52,968 --> 00:06:58,483
Which is of course not less than epsilon, if we choose epsilon less than 1.

68
00:06:58,683 --> 00:07:03,457
In conclusion this property here can't be fulfilled for all epsilon.

69
00:07:03,657 --> 00:07:09,657
Indeed now this is all we have to do to show that this series is not convergent.

70
00:07:09,857 --> 00:07:15,547
So here you see the Cauchy criterion as simple as it is, can be very helpful in calculations

71
00:07:16,329 --> 00:07:20,379
and it is also very helpful for showing the next important fact.

72
00:07:20,579 --> 00:07:27,263
Maybe in this example you have already seen, there is a necessary condition for being a convergent series.

73
00:07:27,463 --> 00:07:32,558
Just take any sequence of real numbers a_k and look at the series

74
00:07:32,758 --> 00:07:40,576
and if this is convergent you know the sequence a_k has to be a sequence that converges to 0.

75
00:07:40,714 --> 00:07:43,822
Ok, here you see the contraposition to this is,

76
00:07:43,823 --> 00:07:51,085
if you start with a sequence a_k that is not convergent to 0, the series we get out is divergent.

77
00:07:51,285 --> 00:07:55,769
and of course here you see immediately one example where you can apply this fact.

78
00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:00,147
-1 to the power k is not a convergent sequence at all.

79
00:08:00,347 --> 00:08:05,294
However one important thing to note here is, this is not an equivalence.

80
00:08:05,494 --> 00:08:10,803
Please remind yourself in the last video we have already seen a counter example for this.

81
00:08:11,003 --> 00:08:16,471
Now I can tell you this proof works similarly to the things we did in the example above.

82
00:08:16,671 --> 00:08:21,094
Therefore I think this is a good exercise for you. Try to prove this fact.

83
00:08:21,514 --> 00:08:29,466
Afterwards, then you know every time someone asks you about series and the convergence of it, you should check this thing here first.

84
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:35,453
However of course most of the time you still don't know if the series is convergent then.

85
00:08:35,653 --> 00:08:42,435
In this case you have to apply another criterion and such another one I show you in the next video.

86
00:08:42,635 --> 00:08:46,429
Therefore I hope I see you there and have a nice day. Bye!

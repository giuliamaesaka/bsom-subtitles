Hello and welcome back to real analysis

2
00:00:03,869 --> 00:00:09,247
and as always many, many thanks for all the nice people that support this channel on Steady or Paypal.

3
00:00:09,447 --> 00:00:13,385
In today's part 18 we will talk about the Leibniz criterion.

4
00:00:13,585 --> 00:00:19,486
In short it's a theorem that gives us the sufficient condition for a series to be convergent.

5
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:24,922
As a good introduction for this, let's recall a series you already know. The Harmonic series.

6
00:00:25,686 --> 00:00:29,952
It's the sequence of partial sums, where we sum over 1/k.

7
00:00:30,152 --> 00:00:33,938
A nice visualization for this would be to look at rectangles.

8
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:40,146
Here all the rectangles should have width 1 and the height should be given by 1/k.

9
00:00:40,671 --> 00:00:46,102
This means that the area of the rectangles are given by our numbers we want to sum up.

10
00:00:46,671 --> 00:00:51,996
Of course here the area of one rectangle gets smaller and smaller when we go to the right.

11
00:00:52,196 --> 00:00:58,457
However we have already shown that the whole infinite sum, the whole area is infinity.

12
00:00:58,814 --> 00:01:04,518
In other words the Harmonic series is not convergent but divergent to infinity.

13
00:01:04,843 --> 00:01:12,168
Therefore having a sequence inside the sum that goes to 0 is not sufficient for convergence of the series.

14
00:01:12,368 --> 00:01:15,911
However we know from the last video it's necessary.

15
00:01:16,357 --> 00:01:20,720
Ok now the Leibniz criterion will fix this missing sufficient condition.

16
00:01:21,071 --> 00:01:24,476
For this we also can use the same visualization.

17
00:01:24,943 --> 00:01:27,645
Let's again look at the rectangles from before.

18
00:01:27,943 --> 00:01:31,909
However now we want to alternate the signs of the areas.

19
00:01:32,686 --> 00:01:39,466
Hence the first area is positive, the second is negative, the third is positive again and so on.

20
00:01:39,714 --> 00:01:48,779
Therefore we don't look at the Harmonic series here, but rather at a sequence of partial sums , where we have (-1) to the power (k+1) in front.

21
00:01:49,471 --> 00:01:53,959
So we have the same sequence involved, but know with alternating signs

22
00:01:54,300 --> 00:02:00,377
and now the Leibniz criterion tells us this is indeed enough to make the whole series convergent.

23
00:02:00,577 --> 00:02:08,044
Therefore please remember adding, subtracting, adding, subtracting and so on, gives us a different behavior than just adding.

24
00:02:08,643 --> 00:02:12,388
Ok, now we are ready to formulate the general Leibniz criterion. 

25
00:02:13,086 --> 00:02:17,726
For obvious reason this is also known as the alternating series test.

26
00:02:17,926 --> 00:02:22,133
Of course there are also other names some people just call it Leibniz's test.

27
00:02:22,829 --> 00:02:27,281
Ok for the formulation let's take a sequence of real numbers called a_k.

28
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:33,893
Now, we already know if we want a convergent series we need this sequence to be convergent with limit 0.

29
00:02:34,643 --> 00:02:39,133
However now we also put in that a_k is monotonically decreasing.

30
00:02:39,414 --> 00:02:43,304
So please keep in mind this is exactly what we have for 1/k

31
00:02:43,857 --> 00:02:48,338
and now the conclusion is that the alternating series here is convergent.

32
00:02:49,114 --> 00:02:55,461
This means whenever you see you have alternating signs you can always check if the Leibniz criterion is applicable.

33
00:02:55,661 --> 00:03:03,340
You just ignore the signs and look if the remaining part defines a sequence with limit 0 and is monotonically decreasing.

34
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:07,505
Ok, now I guess you are interested in the proof of this statement.

35
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:15,771
Indeed this is not so hard. We just defined the partial sums as always and then we will look at suitable subsequences.

36
00:03:16,386 --> 00:03:22,414
So here you see the formulation is a little bit different than before, because here we shifted the index by 1,

37
00:03:22,614 --> 00:03:29,249
which is of course no problem at all, but the picture changes a little bit because the first member here gets a minus sign.

38
00:03:29,871 --> 00:03:33,763
Hence now you see here the correct visualization for our case.

39
00:03:34,057 --> 00:03:38,854
Now the first thing you should note here is that all the a_k's are non-negative,

40
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:43,337
because the limit is 0 and the sequence is monotonically decreasing.

41
00:03:43,537 --> 00:03:45,903
Therefore this picture is indeed correct.

42
00:03:45,971 --> 00:03:51,624
Maybe the sizes of the rectangles are different, but we have that they don't get larger when we go to the right

43
00:03:51,686 --> 00:03:54,159
and we have the alternating sign.

44
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:59,257
Now the first idea, the first subsequence is that we only consider even ends here,

45
00:03:59,457 --> 00:04:03,408
because then you see here, the negative part dominates.

46
00:04:03,914 --> 00:04:12,858
So let's take a natural number "l", then this index is even and then we subtract the predecessor given by an even number as well.

47
00:04:13,486 --> 00:04:17,701
Therefore in the picture what remains are just 2 rectangles, maybe here.

48
00:04:18,371 --> 00:04:26,728
and then we know by assumption that the right area here, can't be bigger than the left area here. Of course measured with the absolute value.

49
00:04:27,314 --> 00:04:29,575
On the other hand in the formula this looks like this.

50
00:04:29,671 --> 00:04:37,429
With the same reasoning, when we subtract the 2 partial sums only 2 terms remain and only the odd number gets the minus sign.

51
00:04:38,043 --> 00:04:43,000
Now, since the sequence is monotonically decreasing this is less or equal than 0.

52
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,769
That's what I said, the negative part here dominates.

53
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,625
Ok, maybe not so surprising we can do the same for odd indices.

54
00:04:51,871 --> 00:04:58,585
This works completely the same but only shifted by one index, which means now the positive part dominates.

55
00:04:58,785 --> 00:05:05,087
Of course we see that in the formula as well. These 2 members remain and the odd index gets the minus sign.

56
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:09,411
Therefore this is again by the monotonicity greater or equal than 0.

57
00:05:10,114 --> 00:05:14,805
Hence the odd indices give us a monotonically increasing subsequence

58
00:05:15,005 --> 00:05:20,704
and on the other hand we have a monotonically decreasing subsequence for the even indices.

59
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:24,651
Ok, then in the next step let's compare both subsequences.

60
00:05:25,329 --> 00:05:31,089
In other words: what is the difference between the members with indices 2l+1 and 2l?

61
00:05:31,571 --> 00:05:37,040
Also this is easy to calculate. It's simply  -a with index 2l+1.

62
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:44,914
Which is less or equal than 0. Hence we get this inequality when we want to compare both subsequences

63
00:05:45,486 --> 00:05:53,471
and now we can put in that we know that this sequence is monotonically decreasing and this sequence is monotonically increasing.

64
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,756
Therefore for all natural numbers "l", we have that s_2l is less or equal than s_2

65
00:06:00,956 --> 00:06:03,933
and the same on the left hand side with S_3.

66
00:06:04,133 --> 00:06:08,405
So from this we conclude that both subsequences are bounded

67
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:14,086
and now you might already recognize one important theorem we had for sequences.

68
00:06:14,429 --> 00:06:17,999
We simply called it the monotone convergence criterion.

69
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:27,346
Here in our case we have a sequence given by the even indices, which is monotonically decreasing and also bounded from below.

70
00:06:28,129 --> 00:06:31,021
Hence we know it's a convergent sequence.

71
00:06:31,771 --> 00:06:39,529
On the other hand we have a sequence which is monotonically increasing and also bounded, so it's also convergent.

72
00:06:40,243 --> 00:06:46,495
We can even show that the limit of both sequences is the same, because we can look at the difference again

73
00:06:46,914 --> 00:06:50,737
We already know it's simply given by a sequence member "a".

74
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:55,595
Therefore when "l" goes to Infinity this sequence goes to 0.

75
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,658
So here we put in our assumption about the limit of the sequence a_k.

76
00:07:00,858 --> 00:07:04,629
Ok, so there's only one limit and we can call it s.

77
00:07:05,329 --> 00:07:11,003
So at this point please recall that we wanted to show that the sequence s_n is convergent.

78
00:07:11,714 --> 00:07:20,363
Here we just considered 2 subsequences. However both subsequences together hit all the sequence members of s_n.

79
00:07:21,014 --> 00:07:26,795
Therefore we can conclude that the limit of s_n is also given by s.

80
00:07:27,286 --> 00:07:32,251
If you have never seen this step here, then it's a good exercise for you to show it.

81
00:07:32,871 --> 00:07:39,232
Nevertheless for us the result here is important. The sequence of partial sums s_n is convergent.

82
00:07:39,714 --> 00:07:48,107
and this closes our proof. So we have proven the Leibniz criterion and now you are allowed to use it whenever you can.

83
00:07:48,786 --> 00:07:52,354
Therefore let's close the video with one last example.

84
00:07:52,857 --> 00:07:59,770
Let's simply consider a series that has -1 to the power k over the square root of k.

85
00:08:00,386 --> 00:08:03,732
So here we have everything we need for the Leibniz criterion.

86
00:08:03,932 --> 00:08:11,048
We have alternating signs and a sequence which is monotonically decreasing and is convergent to 0.

87
00:08:11,686 --> 00:08:15,309
Therefore we know this whole series here is convergent.

88
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:20,647
We cannot immediately calculate the limit, but we know the limit is a real number.

89
00:08:21,214 --> 00:08:24,692
Ok, so that's how you apply the Leibniz criterion.

90
00:08:25,286 --> 00:08:35,286
Ok, then in the next video we will talk about other criteria as well. Therefore I hope I see you there and have a nice day. bye!
